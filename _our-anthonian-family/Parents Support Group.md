<p>The school believes in fostering strong partnerships with homes. Parents
of our Anthonians are invited to participate in and contribute to a range
of programmes and activities based on their areas of interest and/or expertise.</p>
<p>Our PSG members render their support to Anthonians through their participation
in the KidsRead and Reading Mum programmes. They also contribute to the
school’s key events (e.g., Patron’s Day, Teachers’ Day, Children’s Day
and the celebration of festivals), our Catholic Education Programme and
post-PSLE activities for P6 Anthonians.</p>
<p><strong>Join us as a PSG member!</strong>

and caring place for our children to learn, live and grow in.</p>
