The school believes in fostering strong partnerships with homes. Parents of our Anthonians are invited to participate in and contribute to a range of programmes and activities based on their areas of interest and/or expertise.  

  

Our PSG members render their support to Anthonians through their participation in the KidsRead and Reading Mum programmes. They also contribute to the school’s key events (e.g., Patron’s Day, Teachers’ Day, Children’s Day and the celebration of festivals), our Catholic Education Programme and post-PSLE activities for P6 Anthonians.  

**Join us as a PSG member!**

  

As part of the PSG’s efforts to strengthen engagement with parents, we encourage parents who are not in the PSG to join us. The PSG supports school programmes and events to improve our children’s well-being and learning. As a PSG member, you will be helping to make the school a more vibrant and caring place for our children to learn, live and grow in.
