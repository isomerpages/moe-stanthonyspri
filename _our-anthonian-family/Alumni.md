## Alumni 

_Render with Joy to your mater her due..."_

  

The school is initiating the formation our very own Anthonian Alumni. Anthonians of all ages from St Anthony's Boys' School and St Anthony's Primary School are invited and welcomed to be part of the Alumni to continue to be connected to that special time in our lives spent in St Anthony's.&nbsp;&nbsp;
