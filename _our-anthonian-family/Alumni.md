## Alumni 

_Render with Joy to your mater her due..."_

  

The school is initiating the formation our very own Anthonian Alumni. Anthonians of all ages from St Anthony's Boys' School and St Anthony's Primary School are invited and welcomed to be part of the Alumni to continue to be connected to that special time in our lives spent in St Anthony's.  

  

Being part of the official alumni will allow you to reunite, catch up and network with old friends and teachers, as well as to take part in various alumni activities. It will also allow you to register your child under Phase 2A1 instead of 2A2 for former students of the school!
