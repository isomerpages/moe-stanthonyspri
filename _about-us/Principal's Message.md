<h2>Principal's Message</h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 35%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Mrs Esther Choo" src="/images/About%20Us/rsz_esther_choo_white_bg_wp.jpg"></div><p>Dear Parents and Guardians,<br><br>As I move into another year in St. Anthony’s Primary School, I am humbled by the privilege to lead and serve alongside a team of dedicated staff, supportive parents and our invaluable partners. I am grateful for the responsibility we share - to nurture, guide, and inspire our Anthonians, and to bring out the best in them.</p><p>In St Anthony's, we hold firm to the belief that every child is unique and each of them has his or her strengths, interests and potential. Our aim is to provide our Anthonians with experiences and opportunities that help uncover their strengths and passions, while instilling values that go beyond the classroom. We aim to instill in them not just knowledge, but also the curiosity, empathy, and resilience needed to navigate life with grace and purpose. As espoused in our school’s mission, we will enable our children to <em>learn how to learn</em> and to <em>learn how to live</em>, to become persons of integrity and persons for others in God's service. It is our hope and belief that our Anthonians will always do their personal best, always ready to serve and be a blessing to others.<br></p><p>This year holds special significance for us as we celebrate our school’s 145th anniversary. It is a milestone that fills our heart with humility and gratitude as we look back at the journey that has shaped us into who we are today – collective effort of countless hands and hearts.</p><p>The challenges brought by the pandemic have tested our resilience, yet they have also highlighted our unity and gratitude for each other's support.</p><p>&nbsp;As we navigate the year ahead, our commitment to faith, gratitude, and togetherness remains unwavering. We will remain faithful to God and be grateful for the blessings that each day brings. May this year be filled with moments of humility, growth, and a shared sense of purpose as we work in close partnership to develop and take care of our Anthonians. <br><br>Have a blessed year ahead and may God bless you. <br><br>Crescit Eundo<br><br>Yours in Partnership,<br>Mrs Esther Choo<br>Principal</p>
