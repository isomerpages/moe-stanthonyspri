<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,
<br>
</p>
<p>Welcome to another year of learning and growth. As we embark on the year,
we are grateful for Godâ€™s love, a dedicated team of staff, and supportive
parents and stakeholders in our journey of growing and developing our Anthonians.</p>
<p>This year, we are guided by our new vision of nurturing our Anthonians
as<strong><em> Learners for Life, Leaders for the Future, and Lasallians for Others, in service of God, family, and nation. </em></strong>This
is at the core of our educational philosophy and guides our approach as
we nurture and develop our Anthonians to reach their fullest potential.</p>
<p>At the heart of our mission is a commitment to <strong><em>enable our children to learn how to learn</em></strong> and
to <strong><em>learn how to live</em></strong>. We believe that education
is not only about acquiring knowledge but also about developing the skills
to apply that knowledge in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>To grow our Anthonians as <strong><em>Learners for Life</em></strong>,
we seek to equip them with the skills and passion to continuously grow,
adapt, and thrive in an ever-changing world. We encourage them to embrace
a Growth mindset, and nurture in them the disposition of curiosity and
courage, openness and ownership, reflectiveness and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In shaping <strong><em>Leaders for the Future</em></strong>, we prepare
our Anthonians to take on challenges with confidence, responsibility, and
compassion. Through building leadership skills in them, Anthonians will
be empowered to positively influence others and to serve and make meaningful
contributions to their communities.</p>
<p>Rooted in the Lasallian values and tradition, our Anthonians are reminded
to be <strong>Lasallians for Others</strong>, to live lives of service,
not only for themselves but also for others. We encourage them to be persons
for others, guided by the example of our founder St. John Baptist de La
Salle, serving God, family, and nation with humility, compassion, and dedication.</p>
<p>As we navigate the year ahead, we will continue to grow in faith, service
and community, and to be grateful for the blessings that each day brings.
We look forward to working in close partnership with you to develop and
care for our Anthonians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Have a blessed year ahead and may God bless you.
<br>
<br>Crescit Eundo
<br>
<br>Yours in Partnership,
<br>Mrs Esther Choo
<br>Principal</p>
