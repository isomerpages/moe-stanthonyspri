<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>

I am humbled and privileged to be called to lead and serve in St Anthony's Primary School, alongside a team of dedicated staff and supportive parents. It is with a grateful heart that I continue to the good work of my predecessors who have brought the school to where it is today. I will do my utmost to bring out the best in the staff and children, to see to their growth and well-being, and to create meaningful and memorable experiences in their years in school.  
  
In St Anthony's, we believe that every child is unique and each of them has his or her strengths, interests and potential. As our Anthonians go through their school journey, we will provide them with opportunities and experiences to help them explore and discover their strengths, interests and potential. We will develop in our Anthonians the curiosity and passion to learn, the desire to serve and help them realise their aspirations, anchored on strong values and character. As espoused in our schoolâ€™s mission, we will enable our children to learn how to learn and to learn how to live, to become persons of integrity and persons for others in God's service. It is our hope and belief that our Anthonians will always do their personal best, always ready to serve and be a blessing to others.  
  
While we have experienced some disruptions and new norms due to Covid-19 over the past couple of years, we are grateful to God for keeping us safe and we pray that He will continue to bless each and every one of us with His love and grace. As we start the year ahead, we remain faithful to God and be grateful for the blessings that each day brings.  
  
I believe we will work together to develop our Anthonians as individuals with caring hearts and who are passionate and joyful learners, always ready to serve God, family and the nation. I look forward to working in close partnership with you on this journey.  
  
  
Have a blessed year ahead.  
  
Crescit Eundo  
  
Yours in Partnership,  
Mrs Esther Choo  
Principal
