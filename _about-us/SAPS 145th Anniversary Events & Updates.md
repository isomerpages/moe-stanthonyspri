a light for others in whatever simple ways they are capable of.</p>

<p><strong><u>Light the Way</u></strong>
<br>Looking back at all we have
<br>I give thanks to God above
<br>Through the times we had both good and bad
<br>Stood the ones who showed their love
<br>What do I have to offer?
<br>What can I give, I’m just who I am?
<br>But I’m ready now to make my stand.</p>
<p>(Chorus)
<br><em>I’ll light the way</em>
<br><em>Ignite a spark for the world to see</em>
<br><em>I’ll light the way</em>
<br><em>To be the best that I can be</em>
<br><em>I’ll light the way, night or day</em>
<br><em>Through the dark and come what may</em>
<br><em>Shining like the stars</em>
<br><em>I’ll light the way</em>
</p>
<p>We’re called to be salt of the earth
<br>And a light for the world
<br>Share our gifts and talents
<br>Bringing hope to young and old
<br>We’ve been blest with what we have
<br>Now it’s time for us to give
<br>Be a blessing in this world we live</p>
<p><em>We’ll light the way</em>
<br><em>Ignite a spark for the world to see</em>
<br><em>We’ll light the way</em>
<br><em>To be the best that we can be</em>
<br><em>We’ll light the way, night or day</em>
<br><em>Through the dark and come what may</em>
<br><em>Shining like the stars</em>
<br><em>We’ll light the way</em>
</p>
<p><em>We’ll light the way</em>
<br><em>In the darkness of the night</em>
<br><em>We’ll light the way</em>
<br><em>For our future to be bright</em>
<br><em>We’ll light the way, night or day</em>
<br><em>Through the dark and come what may</em>
<br><em>For a better world</em>
<br><em>We’ll light the way</em>
</p>
<p><em>We’ll light the way, night or day</em>
<br><em>Through the dark and come what may</em>
<br><em>For a better world</em>
<br><em>We’ll light the way</em>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>The Anthonian Walk (Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> May 2024)</strong>
<br>Members of our staff, parents and Alumni, along with staff and residents
of HopeHouse participated in a 20-KM Anthonian Walk which began at the
original school site at Victoria Street to our current location at Bukit
Batok. This symbolic walk was not just a stroll through history but a testament
to the enduring legacy and values that St. Anthony's Primary School has
instilled in generations of Anthonians.
