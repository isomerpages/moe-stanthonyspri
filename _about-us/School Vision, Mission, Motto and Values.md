<p><strong>Learners for Life, Leaders for the Future, Lasallians for Others, in service of God, family and nation</strong> 
<br>
<br>As Anthonians, we recognise that we live in an evolving world and that
learning is a lifelong journey. With zeal, grit and a spirit of excellence,
we will continue to develop ourselves holistically to become the best that
we can be. We will strive to be active contributors to our society while
finding meaning and purpose in all that we do.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Grounded in integrity and compassion, we are responsible stewards of what
we have been entrusted with. With thoughtful discernment, we use our voice
and choice to stand for what is right and uplift others. We use our gifts
and talents to be a blessing to others and for the betterment of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rooted in the values of our Founder, we respect and value the dignity
of God’s creations and step forward to serve with love and protect with
care. We are committed to building and strengthening relationships and
we will work harmoniously with members of the community to make our world
a better place, especially for the Last, the Lost and the Least among us.</p>

<p><strong><em>Enabling our children to learn how to learn and to learn how to live, to become persons of integrity and persons for others in God’s service</em></strong>
<br>
<br>As members of the Lasallian community, we believe in solidarity and that
together we are strong. We ‘work together and by association’ to bring
out the best in the children confided to our care. We achieve this by providing
a holistic education that instills the joy of learning and focuses on the
intellectual, physical, aesthetic, spiritual and socio- emotional aspects
of growth. Through our work, students aspire towards a higher purpose in
their lives.</p>

<p><strong><em>Crescit Eundo (Growing as we advance)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Our motto “Crescit Eundo”, meaning that we grow as we advance, is symbolised
by the mythical Phoenix which is part of the school crest. According to
mythology, the Phoenix is supposed to live for five hundred years and then
die, but immediately afterwards, it rises from its ashes a new bird, endowed
with new life and vigour. For Anthonians, it is a reminder to continually
learn and re-invent ourselves regardless of obstacles or failures.</p>
