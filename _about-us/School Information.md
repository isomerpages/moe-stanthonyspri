## School Information

#### The School Crest

<img align="left" style="width:20%" src="/images/School%20Logo%20with%20white%20Background.jpeg">  <div> The School Crest was created in 1879 when St. Anthony's Primary was founded by Father Pedro Sta Anna da Cunha, a Portuguese priest. It was then known as St. Anna's Mission School.

In the centre of the crest is a shield and the seven towers, which can also be found in the national flag of Portugal. The legend behind this comes from the 13th Century, when, just before a great battle, our Lord appeared to the King of Portugal and promised him victory. The king won the battle and from that time onwards, the country's flag showed the five sacred wounds of Jesus and the seven towers representing the seven provinces of Portugal.

Above the centre is a Phoenix with outstretched wings. According to mythology, the Phoenix is supposed to live for five hundred years and then die. However, immediately afterwards, it rises from its ashes a new bird, endowed with new life and vigour. For Anthonians, this is a reminder to continually learn and re-invent ourselves.

Our motto 'CRESCIT EUNDO' (Growing as We Advance) sums up the ideals of the symbols of the school crest. Anthonians are called to grow from strength to strength, and to continually renew our lives. The five-pointed star, or the Signum Fidei, signifies that we are part of the Lasallian Family of schools.

#### The School Rally

Attention Anthonians, your motto still bearing

Promptly respond to your duty’s sweet call;

Harken you all, for the trumpet is sounding,

Your mater’s proclaiming her watchword to all!

Chorus:

Forward her children dear,

Ever with hearts sincere,

Render with joy to your mater her due!

All that is vile reject,

Heaven will e’er protect,

Students of Saint Anthony’s 

Valiant and true!

Onward and upward in life’s earnest battle,

Joyously bearing the brunt of the fight;

Nobly forgiving, for aught that may pain you,

And bravely defending the cause of the right!
