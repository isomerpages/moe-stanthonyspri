The school is named after St. Anthony of Padua.

St. Anthony was canonized (declared a saint) less than one year after his death.


There is perhaps no more loved and admired saint in the Catholic Church than St. Anthony of Padua, a Doctor of the Church. Though his work was in Italy, he was born in Portugal. He first joined the Augustinian Order and then left it to join the Franciscan Order in 1221, when he was 26 years old. The reason he became a Franciscan was because of the death of the five Franciscan protomartyrs -- St. Bernard, St. Peter, St. Otho, St. Accursius, and St. Adjutus -- who shed their blood for the Catholic Faith in the year 1220, in Morocco, North Africa. Their headless and mutilated bodies had been brought to St. Anthony’s monastery on the way for burial. St. Anthony became a Franciscan in the hope of shedding his own blood and becoming a martyr. He lived only ten years after joining the Franciscan Order.

  

So simple and resounding was his teaching of the Catholic Faith, with even the most unlettered and innocent able to understand it, that he was made a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius XII in 1946. Saint Anthony was only 36 years old when he died. He is called the “hammer of the Heretics.” His great protection against their lies and deceits in the matter of Christian doctrine was to utter, simply and innocently, the Holy Name of Mary. When St. Anthony of Padua found he was preaching to heretics who would not listen to him, he went out and preached to the fishes instead. This was not, as liberals and naturalists suggest, for the instruction of the fishes, but rather for the glory of God, the delight of the angels, and the easing of his own heart.

  

He is typically depicted with a book and the Infant Child Jesus, who famously appeared to St. Anthony in a mystical experience, and is commonly referred to today as the "finder of lost articles." Upon exhumation, some 336 years after his death, his body was found to be corrupted, yet his tongue was totally incorrupt, so perfect were the teachings that had been formed upon it.
