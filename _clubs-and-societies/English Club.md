<p>At SAPS, English Club is a supportive space where students develop language</p>
<p>skills and grow as confident communicators. Open to all Primary 2 to 6
students, the</p>
<p>club offers enriching experiences through speaking, performance, and collaborative</p>
<p>activities. In these activities, every child’s voice matter and learning
comes to life</p>
<p>through the power of performance.</p>

<p>Each week, students take part in a range of engaging activities designed
to build theatre</p>
<p>skills and support personal growth. Warm-up games and improvisation sharpen
their</p>
<p>focus, listening skills, and awareness of others. Through voice and movement
work,</p>
<p>they learn how to use pitch, tone, and posture to express meaning and
emotion — skills</p>
<p>that carry over into reading aloud, presentations, and everyday communication.</p>

<p>English Club also introduces students to scripted plays and skits, often
connected to</p>
<p>School events. These performances allow them to practice memorization,
teamwork,</p>
<p>and public speaking. Pantomime and mime exercises teach them the power
of non-</p>
<p>verbal storytelling, helping them understand how body language and facial
expression</p>
<p>can speak volumes without words. Throughout all activities, the focus
remains on</p>
<p>student expression and growth. Children are encouraged to reflect on their</p>
<p>performances, offer feedback to peers, and take ownership of their learning
journey.</p>
<p>Student voice is central. Children are encouraged to share ideas, and
help shape the</p>
<p>actions that are required in the telling of stories. Whether rehearsing
a scene or</p>
<p>playing a game, every child has the chance to shine and feel heard.</p>
