<p>The Robotics Club began in 2003 as a school enrichment programme and was
officially established as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in 2004. Today,
pupils use LEGO Spike Prime kits to design, build, and program robots to
complete a variety of missions.</p>

<p>As pupils embark on their robotics journey, they not only gain technical
skills but also develop important values that shape their character.</p>

<p>Through collaborative problem-solving and hands-on learning, pupils cultivate <strong>teamwork</strong>, <strong>perseverance</strong>,
and <strong>creativity</strong>. They learn to take <strong>responsibility</strong> for
their tasks, show <strong>respect</strong> for different ideas, and build <strong>resilience</strong> by
overcoming challenges and setbacks. These values support their holistic
development and prepare them to be confident and adaptable learners.</p>

<p>Junior members undergo a foundational training programme, where they are
introduced to basic robotics concepts and learn to build and program robots
to complete simple tasks. Senior members participate in an advanced training
programme, where they explore the use of sensors and other LEGO components
to tackle more complex challenges. Some of the competitions that our pupils
participate in are the First Lego League Series and the IDE Series.</p>
