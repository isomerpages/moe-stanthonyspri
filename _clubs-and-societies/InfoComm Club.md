<p>The Club provides opportunities for members to explore various multimedia
tools and platforms, enabling them to develop essential 21st-century skills
such as creativity, problem-solving, and technological literacy. Through
the creation of digital content – ranging from videos and animations to
live presentations – members deepen their subject knowledge, strengthen
critical thinking, and learn to communicate complex ideas effectively to
a wide audience.</p>
