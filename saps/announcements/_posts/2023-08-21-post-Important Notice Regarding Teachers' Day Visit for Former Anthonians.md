Dear former Anthonians,

A number of you have asked if you could visit the teachers on the eve of Teachersâ€™  Day (31 August). 

Please note that the school will be used as a polling centre and students will be dismissed by 10.30am on that day.

As such, if you intend to visit any of your former teachers in SAPS to express your gratitude, you will need to make personal arrangements with them to be present and to only visit the school from 10.30am to 12pm. We will appreciate it if you adhere to the visiting hours of the school as the school will be closed to visitors after 12pm. 

Please also note that you can only gather at the play area next to the bus bay at level 1 to wait for your teachers. 

Seeking your understanding in this matter. Thank you and God bless.
