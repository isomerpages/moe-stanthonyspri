Dear parents/guardians of P6 Anthonians, 

The West Zone (WZ) schools in Singapore has published the “WE STories” which profiles the strengths and distinctiveness of WZ secondary schools. We are happy to share that the publication for 2023 is now ready for use, in time for the upcoming DSA exercise and subsequently, the S1 Option exercise (Nov 2023). The link to the publication can be found below.

Some key features of the publication include:

* Interactive map displaying schools in their geographical location with links to lead readers directly to the respective schools – _Pages 4 & 5_

* Easy referencing of schools’ talent areas for Direct School Admission (DSA), Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) and Learning for Life Programmes (LLP) – _Pages 160 - 165_

* Clickable links to view schools’ videos and artefacts that showcase each school’s distinctiveness.

We hope that this publication will serve as useful tool to broaden your child/ward’s options as they prepare to transit to secondary school education.
