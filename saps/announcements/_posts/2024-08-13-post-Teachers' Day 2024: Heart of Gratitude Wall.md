our teachers and allied educators using this link <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sapstd2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/sapstd2024</a>&nbsp;or
scan the QR code below:</p>

<p>You can post your well wishes from 15 August to 6 September 2024.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for supporting this initiative and your&nbsp;simple
gesture will certainly brighten their day!</p>
