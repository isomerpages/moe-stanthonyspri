<p>St Anthonyâ€™s Sports Carnival 2024 was one of the most highly anticipated
events anticipated by students and staff. It was held on the culmination
day of APEX week to wrap up the semester with a fun-filled day of sporting
activities.</p>
<p>The main objective of the carnival was to raise awareness and promote
the application of Anthonian values: Respect, Integrity, and Resilience
through a buddy system. This system was put in place to develop and strengthen
positive friendships coupled with social skills amongst pupils across different
levels as they participated in the various activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Carnival themed after the Paris Olympic Games offered the perfect
opportunity for pupils to enjoy their favourite sports regardless of their
sporting abilities.&nbsp; It not only gave them a platform to showcase
their sporting excellence, but it also boosted self-esteem and confidence
levels.</p>
