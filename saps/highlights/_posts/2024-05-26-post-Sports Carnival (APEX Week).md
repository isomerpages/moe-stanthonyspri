<p>Sports Carnival was one of the most highly anticipated events as it was
held on the culmination day of APEX week to wrap up the semester with a
fun-filled day of sporting activities.</p>
<p>The main objective of the carnival was to raise awareness and promote
the application of Anthonian values: Respect, Integrity and Resilience
through the buddy system that was put in place to develop and strengthen
friendships amongst pupils across different levels as they participated
in the different activities.&nbsp; This helps pupils develop their social
skills and set them up for positive relationship building for life. Setting
out with the same goal, a team of Anthonians get the chance to show leadership,
teamwork and communication skills as they interact with new people and
face new challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The carnival also offered the perfect opportunity for pupils to enjoy
sports and exercise regardless of their sporting abilities.&nbsp; It not
only gives them a platform to showcase their sporting excellence, but it
can also have a positive impact on pupilsâ€™ self-esteem and overall confidence
levels as they learn to trust in their own abilities and push themselves
to complete the activities.&nbsp;</p>
