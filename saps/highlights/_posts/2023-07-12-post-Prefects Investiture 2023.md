The Prefect Investiture 2023/2024 was a day of pride and joy for all newly appointed prefects and re-appointed prefects. The Prefectsâ€™ Investiture is a ceremony that formally invests selected Anthonians to the role of a prefect. They are representatives of the student body and will lead by example and be a blessing to others.

The prefects will serve the school from July 2023 to June 2024. They will play an integral part in maintaining discipline and safety in the school.
  
A special segment preceded the investiture as the school thanked the Primary 6 prefects for their dedicated and humble service to the school. The out-going Head Prefect, Alice Mabel (6-RE), thanked the school community on behalf of all the P6 prefects for their support in their leadership journey. Mabel and her two fellow out-going Vice Head Prefects then presented the Exco Prefect ties to the new student leadership team.

We are proud to present our newly elected Head Prefect, Liew Jia Min (5-GE), and Vice Head Prefects, Zayden Tan (5-RT) and Arielle Sim (5-FH). The new Head and Vice Head Prefects also thanked the school community for their belief and support and look forward to working together to make the school a more inclusive and conducive learning environment for all Anthonians.

Thank you Anthonians for taking on the challenge of being student leaders to lead and serve the school!
