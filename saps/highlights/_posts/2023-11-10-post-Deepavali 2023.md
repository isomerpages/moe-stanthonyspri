#  Deepavali celebrations at SAPS 2023

SAPS celebrated Deepavali on 1st November. This year the programme took a different spin with AKT creations invited for a performance. Through the interactive programme, children got to understand and appreciate values such as care, sharing, hard work and saving for the future enacted by animals like the ant, peacock and elephant. Some Anthonians and teachers also had a hand at some instruments and dance steps. 
As a culmination to the programme we showcased our very own SAPS talents in a dance performance choreographed by a parent. It was indeed very interactive and enjoyable.

At SAPS we always emphasize on paying it forward. We therefore collaborated with SINDA on their festive gifts packing project. A total of 22 Anthonians, teachers and a parent spent one Saturday morning to do the packing. This activity was also shared with the school.

We wanted to expose Anthonians to some Indian cultural practices such as henna drawing and murukku making so hands-on booths were set up for this purpose and the support from parents was indeed very encouraging as seen below. The programme therefore ended on a joyous mood.
