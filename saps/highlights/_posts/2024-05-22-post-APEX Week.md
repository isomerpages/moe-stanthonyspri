As part of our commitment to nurturing joyful and passionate learners and develop the 21st Century Competencies among our Anthonians, the school organised the Anthonian Positive EXperience (APEX) Week.

Throughout the week, the students had many valuable opportunities to develop their 21st Century Competencies through ICT-related programmes such as touch typing and coding, as well as other activities such as Passion Day, Market Day and Sports Carnival.

Our P5 Anthonians set up experiential booth activities inviting fellow Anthonians to take on the ‘Dining in the Dark’ challenge. They also generously donated at the fundraising stalls, playing a significant role in contributing to the success of the Values-In-Action event. All printed coupons were sold out, resulting in a remarkable fundraising achievement of $3300 for the beneficiaries. We hope this student-initiated project has fulfilled its purpose to raise awareness for people with disabilities and make a positive impact on their lives within our community.

The Sports Carnival 2024 was one of the most highly anticipated events anticipated by students and staff. It was held on the culmination day of APEX week to wrap up the semester with a fun-filled day of sporting activities. The main objective of the carnival was to raise awareness and promote the application of Anthonian values: Respect, Integrity, and Resilience through a buddy system. This system was put in place to develop and strengthen positive friendships coupled with social skills amongst pupils across different levels as they participated in the various activities. 

The Carnival themed after the Paris Olympic Games offered the perfect opportunity for pupils to enjoy their favourite sports regardless of their sporting abilities. It not only gave them a platform to showcase their sporting excellence, but it also boosted self-esteem and confidence levels.
