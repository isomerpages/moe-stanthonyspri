Through the various activities planned to Total Defence 2023, SAPS hopes our Anthonians realise that every single one of us play a part to build a strong, secure and cohesive nation.

From 13 to 15 February, the bus bay and library came alive with various activities such as augmented reality and viewing of display items to learn more about the focus pillar of Military Defence. A big thank-you to our PSG members for making this possible.

On 15 February itself, our Anthonians learnt more about the 6 pillars of defence from veteran SLTC Ng in the morning. It was followed by a presentation of the Total Defence message by Mrs Manuel, our VP, and a few Anthonians.  
  
Before the day ended, Anthonians had the priviledge to learn how the AETOS K-9 unit helps to keep us safe.
