Dressed in red tops and waving their miniature National flags, Anthonians radiated patriotism as they solemnly and yet joyfully participated in the school’s three-part National Day celebrations on the eve of Singapore’s 58th Birthday!  
  
Kickstarting the proceedings was the Observance Ceremony where student leaders from the different groups escorted the National flag to the stage before the singing of the anthem and pledge recitation. Led by members of the English Club, Anthonians then reflected on Singapore’s past and how we have progressed through the years.  
  
The second part of the proceedings was carried out in collaboration with the Mathematics Department. Dubbed “The Singapore Experience”, the Lower and Middle Primary Anthonians carried out activities in class which required them to use their creativity and the various Mathematical concepts learnt to “re-design” local icons like the Changi Control Tower, a Singapore dollar note and coin. The Upper Primary Anthonians moved around the school to carry out a series of tasks which required compass navigational skills, applying concepts of rate, money, discounts, distance and measures to work out the best deals and travel options in order to obtain key codes to “save Singapore” from the pressures of an uncertain future.  
  
The celebrations closed with the third and final part as the Anthonians gathered back in the School Hall for a rousing sing-a-long of our local National Day songs led by our very own teachers and Anthonians!  
  
We hope that this celebration of our nation’s independence not only foster a deep sense of belonging, but also impart valuable lessons in history and unity, and nurturing the next generation of proud Singaporeans.  
  
Happy National Day Singapore!
