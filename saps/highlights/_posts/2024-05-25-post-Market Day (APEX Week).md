<p>Our P5 Anthonians set up experiential booth activities inviting fellow
Anthonians to take on the "Dining in the Dark" challenge. They also generously
donated at the fundraising stalls, playing a significant role in contributing
to the success of the Values-In-Action event. We hope this student-initiated
project has fulfilled its purpose to raise awareness for people with disabilities
and make a positive impact on their lives within our community.</p>
<p>We are excited to share with you that all printed coupons were sold out,
resulting in a remarkable fundraising achievement of $3300 for the beneficiaries.</p>
