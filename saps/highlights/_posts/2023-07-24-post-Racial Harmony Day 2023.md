description: The school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 19th to 21st July
  this year. We were privileged to get Kalari Academy to show the students a
  form of Indian martial arts, the silambam, during our morning assembly
  programme on 19th July. There were also some special menu items sold in the
  canteen, where our students could appreciate food from different races and
  cultures. Students had the chance to play traditional kampung games during
  their recesses as well. It was wonderful to see the smiles on their faces as
  they learn more about the importance of maintaining racial harmony in our
  ethnically diverse country.
