As part of our commitment to nurturing joyful and passionate learners and fostering the development of 21st Century Competencies among our Anthonians, the school organised the Anthonian Positive EXperience (APEX) Week during Term 2, Week 10 (22 - 26 May 2023).  
  
Throughout the week, the students had many valuable opportunities to develop their 21st Century Competencies through ICT-related programmes such as touch typing and coding, as well as other activities such as Passion Day and Market Day. The week culminated in our highly anticipated Sports Carnival where students actively engaged and interacted with their buddies in the exciting games.
