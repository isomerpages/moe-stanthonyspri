The school celebrated its 144th Birthday on 1 August 2023.

Four years ago, as part of our 140th anniversary celebrations, we launched Patron’s Day to celebrate this occasion and also to learn more about life and virtues of the school’s namesake - St. Anthony of Padua.

This year’s Patron’s Day theme is “Light the Way” and will be a running theme throughout the year until our milestone celebration of the 145th Anniversary of the school in 2024!

The theme was introduced at this year's Patron’s Day Assembly Programme as our Anthonians learnt about what it means to be Light to others. A special song for the occasion, composed by a former Anthonian, also debuted at the assembly and sung by some representatives from the School Choir.

A special Patron’s Day Mass was also celebrated by Fr Derrick Yap who challenged the Anthonians who attended to have faith in God, just like St. Anthony of Padua, even when faced with difficult situations or people.

We look forward to this journey together as we light the way to our 145th Anniversary celebrations in 2024!
