<h2>Tchoukball</h2>
<p>The SAPS Tchoukball CCA provides members with a fun and engaging way to
develop teamwork, agility, and strategic thinking. This unique, non-contact
sport emphasizes sportsmanship and cooperation, as players score by bouncing
the ball off a rebound frame, aiming to land it in the opponent's zone
without them catching it.</p>
<p>Through Tchoukball, students enhance their hand-eye coordination, reflexes,
and physical fitness while learning important values like respect, resilience,
and teamwork.</p>
<p>The CCA is inclusive and encourages active participation from all, making
it a great way for students to build friendships and enjoy a positive sporting
experience.</p>
