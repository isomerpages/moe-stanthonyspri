<h2>Robotics Club</h2>
<p>The Robotics was established in 2003 as a school enrichment programme
and was formally initiated as a CCA in 2004. Pupils currently use LEGO
Spikes to build their robots and solve missions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Objective(s)</em>:</strong>
<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide opportunities for pupils to
work together effectively as a team to design, build and program a robot
to perform the desired tasks.
<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage pupils to use the knowledge
gained from completing a robotics task to enhance their learning in the
classroom.</p>
<p><strong><em>Activities</em>:</strong>
<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Junior members attend a basic training
programme where they are introduced to the concept of Robotics and build
and program robots to perform simple tasks. Senior members attend a more
advanced training programme where they will learn how to use sensors and
other Lego components to carry out more complex tasks.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pupils interested in joining this CCA
will have to undergo a selection test based on their performance in the
Robotics Appreciation Day during the APEX week. Selected pupils will be
invited to join the CCA when they are in Primary 3.</p>
<p><strong><em>Venue(s)</em></strong>:
