<h2>Brownies</h2>
<p>Brownies are for Primary 2 to Primary 6 girls who enjoy learning and having
amazing&nbsp; adventures together.</p>
<p>Brownies in SAPS are guided by the Brownie Promise and Law. Our programmes
are aligned to the Comprehensive 5-Point Programme which focuses on Personal
&amp; Social Development,&nbsp; Home, Community, Outdoor and International.</p>
<p>Brownies are encouraged to explore and discover the world around them
and to become an independent individual.&nbsp; Brownies learn to work and
play in a team and individually.</p>
<p>A pack of Brownies consists of 6 sixes (groups) which are led by Sixers
and Seconds (assistant leaders). Tweenie, a new member, will need to pass
the enrollment test in order to become a Brownie. They will then wear their
uniform and receive the Golden Badge.</p>
