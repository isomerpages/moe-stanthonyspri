## Brownies 

The Brownies, known as SAPS 1st Pack, are divided into six groups:Â  Fairy, Elf, Gnome, Sprite, Imp & Pixie. Our members come from Primary One to Primary Six. During meetings, the Tweenies and Brownies play teambuilding games, learn craftwork and do test-work to develop them in the personal, home, outdoor, community and international areas. Their participation and development in these areas earn them badges as well. The Brownies also participate in outdoor camps and activities and empowerment workshops. Activities include Division Days and Outdoor Camps.
