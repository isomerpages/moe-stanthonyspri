<p>Tchoukball is a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in SAPS that provides members
with a fun and engaging way to develop teamwork, agility, and strategic
thinking. This unique, non-contact sport emphasises sportsmanship and cooperation,
as players score by bouncing the ball off a rebound frame, aiming to land
it in the opponent's zone without the opposing team catching it.</p>
