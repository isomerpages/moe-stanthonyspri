<p>Floorball is a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in SAPS that provides students
with a dynamic platform to develop both athletic skills and strong character
values through sport. As a fast-paced and strategic team game, floorball
challenges students physically and mentally, nurturing a spirit of resilience,
teamwork, and discipline. At the heart of the CCA is the belief that sports
serve not just to hone technical ability, but to shape confident and respectful
individuals who can overcome challenges together.</p>

<p>Training sessions are designed to build students’ general fitness and
sport-specific skills progressively. Students undergo a rigorous yet age-appropriate
conditioning program that includes strength training, plyometric exercises,
and cardiovascular workouts to enhance stamina, agility, and coordination.
In tandem with physical training, students also develop their understanding
of the game through drills that focus on attacking and defensive positioning,
passing accuracy, shooting techniques, and coordinated team movement. Through
these structured routines, they gradually improve their game sense, decision-making
skills, and ability to read the play in real-time.</p>

<p>As they train side by side, members forge strong bonds with one another
and learn the importance of communication and trust on and off the court.
Encouraged by their coaches, students are taught to embody good sportsmanship
in every match, demonstrating respect for opponents, supporting their teammates,
and accepting victories or defeats with grace and humility.</p>

<p>For selected Anthonians, the journey extends beyond training as they represent
the school in the National School Games (NSG). This competitive experience
provides invaluable exposure to high-level play, allowing students to apply
what they have learned in real match situations while developing confidence
and composure under pressure. Regardless of the outcome, participating
in NSG reinforces the importance of effort, commitment, and perseverance.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Floorball CCA aims to nurture a team of young athletes
who are not only skilled in the sport but also passionate about self-improvement
and contributing positively to the school’s sporting spirit. Whether on
the court or beyond, members carry with them the values of determination,
teamwork, and integrity as proud representatives of the Anthonian community.</p>
