## Malay Language 

**The Curriculum:**

<img src="/images/ML.jpeg" style="width:auto">

**Making Malay Language a Living Language in Singapore**  

The Malay Language curriculum aims to develop students into proficient users of the language by strengthening their foundation and enriching their use of the language. The department provides Anthonians with a range of platforms and opportunities to notice, appreciate and use the language in different contexts, and revisit language structures and skills. Such opportunities also foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of their ethnic cultures.

The adoption of a flexible syllabus, a range of engaging pedagogies and meaningful assessment modes cater to the holistic development of Anthonians regardless of their starting point.

As oracy is at the forefront of the curriculum, Anthonians are strongly encouraged to use Sebutan Baku to build their confidence and fluency. Our pupils also get to enjoy opportunities to listen to, read and view authentic and age-appropriate texts. Consuming a range of texts also prepares pupils for their writing tasks, which are designed to be purposeful, meaningful and scaffolded according to pupils’ needs.  Guided by the tenets of the Singapore Teaching Practice and incorporating formative assessment techniques and ICT, the Malay Language curriculum actively engages Anthonians and fosters in them a sense of ownership over their own learning. As pupils progress through the six years at SAPS, they will learn to use Malay at increasing levels of complexity.

**Key Programmes / Activities:**

**1.       Sebutan Baku**

Speaking activities are carried out regularly to encourage pupils to use Sebutan Baku  and express their thoughts and views with confidence. At lower primary, Anthonians participate in show-and-tell. Middle primary pupils select and speak about a topic, while upper primary pupils discuss and present their thoughts on current affairs topics. Every class will nominate a Sebutan Baku Ambassador to lead the class in using Sebutan Baku throughout the lesson.

**2.       Reading**

The following activities are organised to inculcate a love for reading Malay language books:

·       Joy of Reading (All levels)

·       Silent Reading (All levels)

·       Nabil Nabilah & Benih (All levels)

·       Use of magazines and Berita Harian (P5–P6)

**3.       Writing & Comprehension & Oral Programme**

Customised, engaging and age-appropriate oracy, writing and comprehension packages have been developed and are used during Malay Language lessons.

**4.       Use of ICT**

ICT tools and platforms such as the Student Learning Space (SLS) and Padlet are used to provide pupils with the opportunity to learn independently as well as to enjoy learning the language.

**5.       Enrichment focusing on Language and Cultural Appreciation**

Enrichment activities are designed to foster a deeper understanding, appreciation and love for the language and culture. The following are some examples:

·       Speech and Drama

·       Competitions

·       Hari Raya Celebration 

·       MT Fortnight

**6.       Our Partners in Education**

The school works closely with parents to promote the use of the language and an appreciation of culture. Parents are encouraged to read with their children. They are also invited to participate in MTL fortnight activities with their children.

To promote the use of and appreciation for the Malay Language, parents can explore the following:

**Recommendations**

**2.       Encourage a love for reading**  

·     Read with your child and visit the library regularly so that they have access to a range of good reading materials; for example, _Berita Harian_ newspaper.

**3.       Encourage a love for writing**

Depending on your child’s readiness and preference, you can encourage them to keep a journal or write simple messages in birthday or thank-you cards.
