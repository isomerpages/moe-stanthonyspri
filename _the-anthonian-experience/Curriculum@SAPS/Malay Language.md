## Malay Language 

**The Curriculum:**

**Making Malay Language a Living Language in Singapore**  

The Malay Language curriculum aims to develop students into proficient users of the language by strengthening their foundation and enriching their use of the language. The department provides Anthonians with a range of platforms and opportunities to notice, appreciate and use the language in different contexts, and revisit language structures and skills. Such opportunities also foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of their ethnic cultures.

The adoption of a flexible syllabus, a range of engaging pedagogies and meaningful assessment modes cater to the holistic development of Anthonians regardless of their starting point.

As oracy is at the forefront of the curriculum, Anthonians are strongly encouraged to use Sebutan Baku to build their confidence and fluency. Our pupils also get to enjoy opportunities to listen to, read and view authentic and age-appropriate texts. Consuming a range of texts also prepares pupils for their writing tasks, which are designed to be purposeful, meaningful and scaffolded according to pupils’ needs.  Guided by the tenets of the Singapore Teaching Practice and incorporating formative assessment techniques and ICT, the Malay Language curriculum actively engages Anthonians and fosters in them a sense of ownership over their own learning. As pupils progress through the six years at SAPS, they will learn to use Malay at increasing levels of complexity.
