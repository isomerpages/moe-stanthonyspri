## Mathematics 

### Department Vision

_Anthonians are life-long learners who are able to build self-confidence in learning Mathematics and apply concepts they have learnt in the world around them._

  

In order to achieve our vision, teachers use the following strategies in lesson planning so as to nurture caring, passionate, joyful and future-ready learners: 

*   develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving 
*   build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics by providing authentic teaching and learning experiences that infuse SAPS Social Teachings
*   differentiate the delivery of curriculum, taking into account the strengths, weaknesses and interests of our pupils

  

### Progression of the Curriculum across Levels


Mathematics at the primary level is a stage where pupils acquire important basic numeracy as well as develop logical reasoning and problem solving skills that are required in many disciplines. In SAPS, we follow the Mathematics Curriculum Framework closely. The central focus of the Mathematics curriculum is the development of mathematical problem solving competency. Supporting this focus are five inter-related components- concepts, skills, processes, metacognition and attitudes.
