Vision  | To grow Anthonians into&nbsp;confident and effective communicators of the English Language   | 
Mission   | To provide a rich environment for Anthonians&nbsp;to enjoy and apply their learning

**Our teaching and learning approach**

In SAPS, we draw reference from the SAPS Teaching and Learning Framework when designing and implementing lessons to provide our Anthonians with a sound education grounded in the Lasallian ethos. The framework encompasses the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) which guides and supports teachers in their considerations in designing and implementing quality and effective lessons. The school adopts an integrated approach in designing an English Language curriculum aligned with MOE’s English Syllabus 2023. Besides STELLAR, which is the core programme designed by MOE curriculum specialists, the school incorporates its own school-based programme to develop Anthonians to be confident and effective users of the language.

Progression of the Curriculum across Levels
-------------------------------------------

#### STELLAR 2.0

  
The Strategies for English Language Learning And Reading 2.0 (STELLAR 2.0) curriculum focuses on strengthening students’ foundation in &nbsp;grammar, oracy, writing and reading. It also reinforces the teaching of receptive and productive skills, namely:

*   Reading and Viewing
*   Listening and Viewing
*   Writing and Representing
*   Speaking and Representing
*   Grammar and Vocabulary

STELLAR 2.0 from Primary 1 to Primary 3 uses the following strategies:

*   Shared Book Approach (SBA)

*   Reading of big books and engaging in class discussions
*   Teaching of explicit grammar and oracy skills, as well as close and critical reading skills

*   Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA) and Guided Writing
*   Differentiated Focused Lessons (DFLs)&nbsp;

#### Our Library Programme

  

Our school collaborates with the National Library Board to carry out many of its signature reading programmes throughout the year. These include Book Buzz and Book Bugs. We also design our very own Library Curriculum, which is tailored to the needs of our Anthonians. The Library Curriculum is incorporated into our English Language curriculum to expose our Anthonians to a variety of genres and cultivate a love for reading. Apart from this, the school library also carries out activities based on monthly themes.&nbsp;

We also collaborate with NLB to conduct the Raising Readers workshop for parents of our P1 and P2 Anthonians. Through the workshop, parents learn about choosing the right books and how to create a positive reading experience for their children.

In addition, we provide opportunities for our Anthonians to serve the school as School Librarians. School Librarians volunteer their time to help out in the library after school and learn about the administration and operations of the library. They also assist in preparing materials for the monthly thematic activities and are advocates to promote reading among their peers.

#### Our Reading Programmes

  

To support our Anthonians with different needs in their effort to master language and literacy skills, we have the following programmes:

  

**<u>Learning Support Programme</u>**&nbsp;

The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is an early intervention programme that provides additional support for P1 and P2 Anthonians who have weak language and literacy skills. These Anthonians are identified at the start of P1 to attend daily 30-minute LSP lessons which are conducted by the school’s Learning Support Coordinator during curriculum time. In small groups of not more than ten pupils, they are taught the basic knowledge and skills to read and spell words, and to read texts with fluency and understanding.

**<u>Reading Remediation Programme</u>**&nbsp;

The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) is an additional literacy support programme implemented at P3 and P4 to support Anthonians who still face difficulty in reading despite having completed the LSP in P1 and P2. The programme is carried out twice a week after school by our English teachers. The objectives of this programme are to expose these Anthonians to a range of coping strategies for reading comprehension, close the reading gap so that they read at their grade level, and enable them to better manage their learning in the regular classroom.

  

**<u>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme</u>**&nbsp;

The School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme is a two-year intervention programme for P3 and P4 Anthonians. These Anthonians are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of P2. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists. Anthonians in the programme attend after-school lessons four times a week to help build their reading, spelling and comprehension skills so that they are better able to cope with their learning in the regular classroom.

  

**<u>kidsREAD</u>**

The kidsREAD programme is a collaborative effort by the school, our Parent Support Group (PSG) and the National Library Board (NLB). It aims to cultivate the love of reading and to promote good reading habits in P1 and P2 Anthonians who are from financially disadvantaged families. It also provides an avenue for children from diverse backgrounds to interact with one another at an early age. This weekly one-hour session after school is led by Parent Volunteers trained in basic storytelling.
  

**<u>Little Red Dot (LRD)</u>**&nbsp;

To introduce the habit of reading newspapers, all upper primary Anthonians (P5 &amp; P6) subscribe to the LRD (Little Red Dot), a Straits Times supplement for primary school pupils. Through LRD, Anthonians get to read and learn about current affairs, both local and global, with elements of social emotional learning, values education and National Education. Its accompanying lesson activities are aligned with the MOE EL Syllabus and pegged to the learning of specific skills such as comprehension, writing, grammar and even critical thinking. This is incorporated into the English lessons weekly.

#### Our Speaking Programmes

  

**<u>English Language Speech Arts (E.L.S.A.)</u>**&nbsp;

In order to nurture confident and empathetic communicators,&nbsp;our school-based English Language Speech Arts (E.L.S.A.) programme aims to cultivate Anthonians’ interest in speech arts and provides them with opportunities to practise their oratorical skills.&nbsp;  

Anthonians will start off their learning journey in P1 and P2 with a theatrical experience and workshop. Various activities will be conducted to help them to develop awareness and knowledge of speaking and representing. They will then build up their oracy as they participate in teacher-designed activities in class. For example, P5 and P6 Anthonians will take part in discussions and debates on current affairs which encourages them to share various viewpoints on selected newspaper articles. Through these undertakings, we aim to equip them with the key critical thinking and communication skills.

**<u>Talent Development Programme (TDP)</u>**&nbsp;

This programme focuses on enhancing oratorical skills in debating and public speaking among our upper primary Anthonians. Anthonians who have an aptitude for or an interest in honing their oratorical skills are invited to join the programme. 

Under the guidance of a debate coach, they learn to carry out research to look for substantiated points of information, structure their arguments in a logical and coherent manner, and debate these points with their peers. Selected Anthonians participate in inter-school competitions&nbsp;such as Wits and Words.

**<u>English Club</u>**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Through the use of storytelling and drama, members of the English Club CCA are immersed in a language-rich environment. They participate in activities that provide them with opportunities to develop teamwork and creativity. Through fun vocalisation activities and performances, they hone their language skills and build their confidence.&nbsp; These fun and engaging activities help them to cultivate a love for the language and provide opportunities to use English purposefully.&nbsp;

#### Our Writing Programme

  

**Writers on the Web (WoW)**&nbsp;

WoW provides upper primary Anthonians with opportunities to write and share their compositions on a secured online platform. Compositions are first posted online to be read by their peers who will then provide constructive feedback in order for improvements to be made. Through this approach, Anthonians learn to give feedback to their peers. It builds a greater sense of purpose in writing as it helps Anthonians to see that a reader’s perspective can be different from a writer’s perspective.
