Department Vision and Mission
-----------------------------

**<center>Vision</center>**

<center>To grow Anthonians into confident and effective communicators of the English Language</center>

**<center>Mission</center>**

<center>To provide a rich environment for Anthonians to enjoy and apply their learning</center>

**Our teaching and learning approach**

In SAPS, we draw reference from the SAPS Teaching and Learning Framework when designing and implementing lessons to provide our Anthonians with a sound education grounded in the Lasallian ethos. The framework encompasses the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) which guides and supports teachers in their considerations in designing and implementing quality and effective lessons. The school adopts an integrated approach in designing an English Language curriculum aligned with MOE’s English Syllabus 2020. Besides STELLAR, which is the core programme designed by MOE curriculum specialists, the school incorporates its own school-based programme to develop Anthonians to be confident and effective users of the language.

Progression of the Curriculum across Levels
-------------------------------------------

#### STELLAR 2.0

  
The Strategies for English Language Learning And Reading 2.0 (STELLAR 2.0) curriculum focuses on strengthening students’ foundation in  grammar, oracy, writing and reading. It also reinforces the teaching of receptive and productive skills, namely:

STELLAR 2.0 from Primary 1 to Primary 3 uses the following strategies:

#### Our Library Programme

  

Our school collaborates with the National Library Board to carry out many of its signature reading programmes throughout the year. These include Book Buzz and Book Bugs. We also design our very own Library Curriculum, which is tailored to the needs of our Anthonians. The Library Curriculum is incorporated into our English Language curriculum to expose our Anthonians to a variety of genres and cultivate a love for reading. Apart from this, the school library also carries out activities based on monthly themes. 

We also invite NLB to conduct the Raising Readers workshop for parents of our P1 and P2 Anthonians. Through the workshop, parents learn about the Reading Virtuous Cycle and how to create a positive reading experience for their children.

In addition, we provide opportunities for our Anthonians to serve the school as School Librarians. School Librarians volunteer their time to help out in the library after school and learn about the administration and operations of the library. They also assist in preparing materials for the monthly thematic activities and are advocates to promote reading among their peers.

#### Our Reading Programmes

  

To support our Anthonians with different needs in their effort to master language and literacy skills, we have the following programmes:

  

**Learning Support Programme** 

The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is an early intervention programme that provides additional support for P1 and P2 Anthonians who have weak language and literacy skills. These Anthonians are identified at the start of P1 to attend daily 30-minute LSP lessons which are conducted by the school’s Learning Support Coordinator during curriculum time. In small groups of not more than ten pupils, they are taught the basic knowledge and skills to read and spell words, and to read texts with fluency and understanding.
