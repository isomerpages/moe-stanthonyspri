## Student Development 

**<u>Introduction</u>**  

The Student Development Team is made up of the Year Heads, Subject Head (Student Development) and Level Managers. We work closely with the CCE department and Pupil Discipline & Leadership team to oversee the holistic development of our Anthonians.

**Growth Mindset@SAPS**


We are a Lasallian and Catholic school committed to learning for life and aiming for excellence. We know that pupils with a positive attitude will make good progress and be successful. Growth Mindset@SAPS is a whole-school approach to build a growth mindset culture and make passionate and joyful learners out of our students. 

  

Mindsets are the beliefs that people have about their abilities. The research of Carol Dweck, a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, has shown that people who believe that their intelligence can be developed (growth mindset) outperform those who believe their intelligence is static (fixed mindset). When children learn that they can “grow their brains” and increase their intellectual abilities, they do better. 

  

At SAPS, instilling in our pupils a growth mindset has become a key priority for the school. As part of our Back-to-School programme in 2021, we introduced the theories of Dr Carol Dweck to staff and pupils and sought to embed its ideas in our school ethos. 

  

We introduce Anthonians to the key concepts of growth mindset at Assembly Talks, Pre-Assembly programs and Back-to-School activities. We teach them about the anatomy and functions of the brain. When they understand how their brain changes and grows in response to challenges, they are much more likely to persevere when they fail because they understand that failure is not a permanent condition. They believe that they can improve with effort and the right strategies. We show them how mistakes and failures are part of the learning process and how they must learn from every mistake and get better at things that are hard. Teachers incorporate growth mindset language and a questioning framework to facilitate reflection into the daily routine of the classroom. The culture of growth mindset underlies not only the curriculum but also the physical space of our classrooms.  

  

This year, we embarked on our growth mindset journey as a school to learn how we can grow our brains and intelligence and achieve anything we want!

Each class creates an environment where growth mindset messages are promoted and where the differences between a fixed and growth mindset are evident and can be easily referred to.
