## Student Development 

**<u>Introduction</u>**  

The Student Development Team is made up of the Year Heads, Subject Head (Student Development) and Level Managers. We work closely with the CCE department and Pupil Discipline & Leadership team to oversee the holistic development of our Anthonians.

**Growth Mindset@SAPS**


We are a Lasallian and Catholic school committed to learning for life and aiming for excellence. We know that pupils with a positive attitude will make good progress and be successful. Growth Mindset@SAPS is a whole-school approach to build a growth mindset culture and make passionate and joyful learners out of our students. 

  

Mindsets are the beliefs that people have about their abilities. The research of Carol Dweck, a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, has shown that people who believe that their intelligence can be developed (growth mindset) outperform those who believe their intelligence is static (fixed mindset). When children learn that they can “grow their brains” and increase their intellectual abilities, they do better. 

  

At SAPS, instilling in our pupils a growth mindset has become a key priority for the school. As part of our Back-to-School programme in 2021, we introduced the theories of Dr Carol Dweck to staff and pupils and sought to embed its ideas in our school ethos. 

  

We introduce Anthonians to the key concepts of growth mindset at Assembly Talks, Pre-Assembly programs and Back-to-School activities. We teach them about the anatomy and functions of the brain. When they understand how their brain changes and grows in response to challenges, they are much more likely to persevere when they fail because they understand that failure is not a permanent condition. They believe that they can improve with effort and the right strategies. We show them how mistakes and failures are part of the learning process and how they must learn from every mistake and get better at things that are hard. Teachers incorporate growth mindset language and a questioning framework to facilitate reflection into the daily routine of the classroom. The culture of growth mindset underlies not only the curriculum but also the physical space of our classrooms.  

  

This year, we embarked on our growth mindset journey as a school to learn how we can grow our brains and intelligence and achieve anything we want!

Each class creates an environment where growth mindset messages are promoted and where the differences between a fixed and growth mindset are evident and can be easily referred to.

**<center>Teachers’ Training</center>**

Besides Growth Mindset training for teachers, customised experiential and interactive training programmes were designed for segments of students so they do not just learn the content but experience it. For our P1 and P2 Anthonians, it was a highly interactive and hands-on session to create awareness and introduce them to the concept of Growth Mindset. Through activities such as  Stacko Challenge and Dominoes Fun, they learnt to use growth mindset language and positive self-talk to help them succeed in accomplishing difficult or new tasks. They also learnt to seek challenges, identify the difficulties they may face and reflect on the learning that can be drawn from their failures.

Our Primary 4 and 5 Anthonians had fun discovering the difference between a Growth and Fixed mindset through the Mindset Board Game Workshop. Self-discovery definitely makes the learning deeper and more engaging!

A growth mindset empowers students. It changes their reaction to failure, giving them the motivation and confidence to work hard to achieve their full potential.

**Executive Function Skills (EFS)**  

Executive function refers to a set of skills that underlies the capacity to plan ahead and meet goals, display self-control, follow multiple-step directions even when interrupted, and stay focused despite distractions, among others. They can be developed through experience and practice.

In SAPS, teachers set up the framework for their students to learn and practise these skills over time by establishing routines, breaking big tasks into smaller chunks, and encouraging games that promote imagination, role-playing, following rules, and controlling impulses (see Table 1). 

We believe that the increasingly competent executive functioning of children and adolescents will enable them to learn how to learn and learn how to live so that they will become persons of integrity and persons for others in God's service.
