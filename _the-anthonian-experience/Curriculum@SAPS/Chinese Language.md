 **<center>Chinese Language Curriculum Objective</center>**

In Singapore, the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) curriculum focuses on developing students’ Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing and Interaction (verbal and written) skills. The Chinese Language (CL) curriculum is organised thematically, which allows students to explore the use of the language in situations they encounter in their everyday life. 

St. Anthony’s Primary School’s CL curriculum is anchored on MOE’s curriculum objective of developing proficient language users by adopting the modular approach to:

·       improve students’ language skills,

·       cultivate good character and cultural awareness, and

·       enhance students’ competency in applying skills to become life-long learners.
