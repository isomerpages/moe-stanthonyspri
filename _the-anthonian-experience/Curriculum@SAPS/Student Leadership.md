<p>At the heart of our school’s student leadership philosophy lies the belief
that <strong>every child can be a leader</strong>. Our structured, progressive
leadership framework empowers students to grow in character, confidence,
and competence as they journey from self-leadership to leading others.</p>
<p>Our student leadership development is anchored in a <strong>four-tiered model</strong>:</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 1 – Leading Self</strong>: At this foundational level, all
students are encouraged to develop self-discipline, responsibility, and
a growth mindset. Leadership learning is embedded in the curriculum and
reinforced through daily routines. This stage nurtures self-awareness and
self-management, forming the building blocks of effective leadership.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 2 – Leading Peers</strong>: Students begin to lead within
their immediate circles. Opportunities include serving on Class Committees
(P1–2 by teacher nomination; P3–6 through student applications), and taking
on roles as Student Ministry Leaders and CCA Leaders. These platforms help
students practise communication, collaboration, and peer influence in authentic
contexts.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 3 – Leading Teams</strong>: At this stage, students are entrusted
with greater responsibilities. Leadership roles include Prefects, School
CyTech Champions, and Peer Support Leaders. These students represent their
peers, initiate projects, and support school-wide initiatives, honing their
skills in decision-making and team leadership.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 4 – Leading Leaders</strong>: This tier features our most
experienced student leaders—those who serve as executive committee members
in the Prefectorial Board, School CyTech Leadership Board, and Peer Support
Squad. These leaders mentor their juniors, spearhead impactful initiatives,
and influence positive change at the school level.</p>
