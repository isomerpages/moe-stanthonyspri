## Aesthetics 

|  |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Mission     | To enable our pupils to learn about the arts and to use their knowledge, skills and talents to contribute to society     | 
| Vision     | A school with a lively arts atmosphere where pupils appreciate the arts and aspire to use their talents in service of God, family and nation.     | 
|  |  | 

At SAPS, we aim to nurture Anthonians’ appreciation of the arts. For Visual Arts, we provide pupils with opportunities for guided exploration and experimentation with a range of artistic techniques. For Music, we provide platforms for Anthonians to share the joy of experiencing and appreciating music. We also encourage our pupils to see the relevance of the arts in other subject areas and to their own lives.

The Art and Music curricula emphasise active responses in music and art-making at all levels. Learning experiences are designed to develop Anthonians’ thinking skills and appreciation of a range of artistic and musical styles, forms and techniques.

**<center>Visual Arts</center>**

Our **Art Curriculum** allows pupils to:
* Explore the expressive possibilities of a variety of art forms including 2D art, 3D art, ceramics and digital art.
* Appreciate art and respond to a wide range of art forms including various artists and art creation styles from different periods, cultures and countries. 
* Demonstrate their learning of the art creation styles inspired by the artists’ works and describe differences between art pieces, showing a sense of the elements of art (shape, form, colour, lines and texture) and style.
* Share their personal/group creative art-making process and creations with others.
* Create artist-inspired works using other art mediums.
* Create digital art works using ICT tools (SAPS LLP - Digital Art Programme).
* Create art works using clay as a medium (SAPS LLP - Ceramics Programme)

_Art Elective Programme_

Our Art Elective Programme is for P2 to P6 Anthonians who have a greater interest in or aptitude for visual arts.  These students enjoy exposure and support through customised activities and specialised training sessions. The programme strengthens pupils’ artistic skills by allowing them to explore art elements and harness their creativity to create unique works of art.

_ArtsReach Programme_

The ArtsReach programme enables Anthonians to use the artistic skills they have learnt to be a blessing to the community, in alignment with our Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community. ArtsReach includes school-based activities as well as collaborations with external partners. Our Anthonians enjoy these meaningful opportunities to interact with and serve others.

**Our Partners**

We work closely with the following partners so that our pupils learn to appreciate art, apply their skills and serve others in authentic contexts.

_Hong Kah Day Care Centre and St Luke’s Elderly Care Centre_

Over the years, Anthonians enjoyed visiting these centres to interact with residents and guide them through art activities. More recently, despite the constraints posed by COVID-19, our pupils have continued to bring cheer to the residents by making art works which were then brought to the centres by our teachers.  

_Fei Yue Community Services_

SAPS supports the Intergenerational Learning Programme, which encourages seniors to sign up for courses to learn new skills. In partnership with Fei Yue Community Services, Anthonians conduct art workshops where they guide participants through creative processes such as ceramics and Zentangle patterns.

_Singapore Art Museum_

SAPS collaborates with the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) to develop in our pupils skills and dispositions such as museum etiquette, art appreciation and 21st century competencies. The highlight of our partnership is _Think! Contemporary_, a museum-based programme organised for our P4 Anthonians in collaboration with SAM and four other primary schools. _Think! Contemporary_ incorporates artwork from SAM’s collection as primary resources for art lessons, and the programme includes school-based art trails and assembly programmes by SAM. The programme culminates in an online exhibition by SAM, where selected student works are featured.

_Hong Kah North Community Centre and PAssionArts Singapore_

Our Performing Arts groups (Band, Choir, Contemporary Dance, Chinese Dance) and Visual Arts groups participate in the annual PAssionArts Festival at Hong Kah North CC. This event is an opportunity for our pupils to showcase their art works and performances to the public.

**<center>Music</center>**

The school’s **Music Curriculum** consists of three aspects - **_Learn it!_**, **_Play it!_** and **_Love it!_**.

![](/images/Music%20Art%2021.jpeg)

**Learn it!**

In SAPS, all Anthonians enjoy a music curriculum which allows them to learn the basic elements of music such as rhythm, tempo and pitch.

**Play it!**

With the fundamentals right, Anthonians learn to play music through creative music-making processes using musical instruments, digital applications (e.g., Garageband) and everyday objects.

**Love it!**

With a sound foundation and opportunities to have fun in the process, Anthonians will grow to love and appreciate music with increasing sensitivity.

**Music Programmes**

_Performing Arts Exposure Programme_

This programme is extended to P1 and P2 Anthonians to expose them to the various Performing Arts CCAs (Choir, Brass Band, Chinese Dance and Contemporary Dance). Anthonians will be able to experience the activities that are carried out within the CCAs like dancing with cultural music, choral singing, understanding of percussion and brass instruments. During the exposure programme, Anthonians will also be introduced to musical concepts like beats, tempo, instrument identification, and singing with appropriate pitch and rhythm.

_Programme for Active Learning (PAL) - Music_

The PAL music module allows pupils to experience music activities, develop a range of skills, interact with their peers and build confidence. The module incorporates values education and provides multiple opportunities for pupils to apply and strengthen their social and emotional competencies.

The module also offers a myriad of opportunities for pupils to listen, create and perform. Through this module, students learn fundamental music concepts such as beat and rhythm, pitch, tempo and dynamic changes. They will experience music through listening to different kinds of world music and sounds, creating rhythmic chants, representing what they hear using graphic notation, responding through body movement, and singing. By participating in individual and group music activities, our pupils learn to apply the fundamental music concepts they have learnt to different situations and engage in music learning through exploration and play.
