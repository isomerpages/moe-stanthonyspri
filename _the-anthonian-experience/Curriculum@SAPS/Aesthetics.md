## Aesthetics 

**<center>Mission</center>**

<center>To enable our pupils to learn about the arts and to use their knowledge, skills and talents to contribute to society.</center>

**<center>Vision</center>**

<center>A school with a lively arts atmosphere where pupils appreciate the arts and aspire to use their talents in service of God, family and nation.</center>

At SAPS, we aim to nurture Anthonians’ appreciation of the arts. For Visual Arts, we provide pupils with opportunities for guided exploration and experimentation with a range of artistic techniques. For Music, we provide platforms for Anthonians to share the joy of experiencing and appreciating music. We also encourage our pupils to see the relevance of the arts in other subject areas and to their own lives.

The Art and Music curricula emphasise active responses in music and art-making at all levels. Learning experiences are designed to develop Anthonians’ thinking skills and appreciation of a range of artistic and musical styles, forms and techniques.

**<center>Visual Arts</center>**

Our **Art Curriculum** allows pupils to:

·         Explore the expressive possibilities of a variety of art forms including 2D art, 3D art, ceramics and digital art.

·         Appreciate art and respond to a wide range of art forms including various artists and art creation styles from different periods, cultures and countries. 

·         Demonstrate their learning of the art creation styles inspired by the artists’ works and describe differences between art pieces, showing a sense of the elements of art (shape, form, colour, lines and texture) and style.

·         Share their personal/group creative art-making process and creations with others.

·         Create artist-inspired works using other art mediums.

·         Create digital art works using ICT tools (SAPS LLP - Digital Art Programme).

·         Create art works using clay as a medium (SAPS LLP - Ceramics Programme)
