## Physical and Sports Education

Department Vision
-----------------

Every Anthonian, a passionate and joyful learner who strives to lead and enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

The Physical Education (PE) curriculum seeks to develop in each Anthonian the ability to:

*   Acquire a range of fundamental motor skills and core values to participate in and enjoy a wide variety of physical activity and sports at a recreational level.
*   Be responsible for their own learning by providing them with the capacity to make reasoned and wise choices. 
*   Demonstrate the spirit of fair play, teamwork and sportsmanship across different experiences. 
*   Acquire safe practices during participation with respect for themselves, others and the environment.  
*   Enjoy the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

Through the school’s PE programme, students learn the fundamental movement and motor skills and develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance as they practise and transfer their skills across the seven learning areas of Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness, and Swimming to become competent movers.

The learning areas for each level are shown in the table below:

|        Learning Areas       |  Levels  |
|:---------------------------:|:--------:|
|            Dance            | P1 to P6 |
|       Games and Sports      |          |
|          Gymnastics         |          |
|      Outdoor Education      |          |
| Physical Health and Fitness |          |
|           Swimming          |    P3    |
|          Athletics          | P3 to P6 |

In addition to the PE curriculum, the PSE Department engages and educates Anthonians about living a healthy and active lifestyle through our PAL, Outdoor Education and Healthy Meals programmes.

**<u>P1 and P2 PAL Programme</u>**

In Programme for Active Learning (PAL), students enjoy learning experiences in the four modules of Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts (Music, Dance and Drama) and Visual Arts. These learning experiences facilitate their holistic development in the physical, cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral domains. They develop in Anthonians a sense of curiosity, a positive attitude towards learning and confidence through group experiences and teamwork.

  

The programmes are aligned with the level Character and Citizenship (CCE) and Living Well curriculum outcomes of:

*   A responsible and respectful Anthonian who cares for self, family and peers (Primary 1)
*   A responsible and respectful Anthonian who cares and serves within the family and class (Primary 2)
