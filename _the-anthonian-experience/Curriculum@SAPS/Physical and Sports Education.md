## Physical and Sports Education

Department Vision
-----------------

Every Anthonian, a passionate and joyful learner who strives to lead and enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

The Physical Education (PE) curriculum seeks to develop in each Anthonian the ability to:

*   Acquire a range of fundamental motor skills and core values to participate in and enjoy a wide variety of physical activity and sports at a recreational level.
*   Be responsible for their own learning by providing them with the capacity to make reasoned and wise choices. 
*   Demonstrate the spirit of fair play, teamwork and sportsmanship across different experiences. 
*   Acquire safe practices during participation with respect for themselves, others and the environment.  
*   Enjoy the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

Through the school’s PE programme, students learn the fundamental movement and motor skills and develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance as they practise and transfer their skills across the seven learning areas of Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness, and Swimming to become competent movers.

The learning areas for each level are shown in the table below:

|        Learning Areas       |  Levels  |
|:---------------------------:|:--------:|
|            Dance            | P1 to P6 |
|       Games and Sports      |          |
|          Gymnastics         |          |
|      Outdoor Education      |          |
| Physical Health and Fitness |          |
|           Swimming          |    P3    |
|          Athletics          | P3 to P6 |

In addition to the PE curriculum, the PSE Department engages and educates Anthonians about living a healthy and active lifestyle through our PAL, Outdoor Education and Healthy Meals programmes.
