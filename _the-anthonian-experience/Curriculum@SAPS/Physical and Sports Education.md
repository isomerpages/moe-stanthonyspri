## Physical and Sports Education Department 

|  |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
Vision     |  Every Anthonian, a passionate and joyful learner who strives to lead and enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living 
| | | 


The Physical Education (PE) curriculum seeks to develop in each Anthonian the ability to:

*   Acquire a range of fundamental motor skills and core values to participate in and enjoy a wide variety of physical activity and sports at a recreational level.
*   Be responsible for their own learning by providing them with the capacity to make reasoned and wise choices. 
*   Demonstrate the spirit of fair play, teamwork and sportsmanship across different experiences. 
*   Acquire safe practices during participation with respect for themselves, others and the environment.  
*   Enjoy the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

Through the school’s PE programme, students learn the fundamental movement and motor skills and develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance as they practise and transfer their skills across the seven learning areas of Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness, and Swimming to become competent movers.

The learning areas for each level are shown in the table below:

In addition to the PE curriculum, the PSE Department engages and educates Anthonians about living a healthy and active lifestyle through our PAL, Outdoor Education and Healthy Meals programmes.

**<u>P1 and P2 PAL Programme</u>**

In Programme for Active Learning (PAL), students enjoy learning experiences in the four modules of Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts (Music, Dance and Drama) and Visual Arts. These learning experiences facilitate their holistic development in the physical, cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral domains. They develop in Anthonians a sense of curiosity, a positive attitude towards learning and confidence through group experiences and teamwork.

  

The programmes are aligned with the level Character and Citizenship (CCE) and Living Well curriculum outcomes of:

*   A responsible and respectful Anthonian who cares for self, family and peers (Primary 1)
*   A responsible and respectful Anthonian who cares and serves within the family and class (Primary 2)

**<u>P3 SwimSafer Programme</u>**

  

Swimming is one of the key learning areas in the Physical Education syllabus. It aims to develop students’ confidence and movement skills through water, and is carried out for all Primary 3 Anthonians. The school leverages the SwimSafer Programme by SportsSG to equip students with basic swimming and survival skills. 

**<u>P4 and P5 Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Camps</u>**

  

OAL Cohort Camps provide rich and authentic learning experiences for students to apply the knowledge, skills and values acquired from their CCE and Outdoor Education lessons. Our camps provide Anthonians with a range of experiences such as working with their peers to overcome challenges or navigating in a new environment during a journey. They enjoy opportunities to put into practice their outdoor living, navigation, risk assessment and management skills. Such experiences promote student decision-making and a sense of ownership of their learning. Students will also have opportunities to be immersed in and have direct interactions with the environment to gain a personal connection with the place.

**<u>Healthy Meals in Schools Programme</u>**

As part of our continual efforts to ensure that Anthonians eat healthy food in the school, the school adopts HPB’s Healthy Meals in School Programme (HMSP). HPB works with our canteen vendors to draw up menus for healthy and balanced set meals. Nutritionists and chefs give their input, and care is taken to ensure that your child enjoys a well-balanced and nutritious meal.  

Each meal comes with a good mix of food from the four main food groups – brown rice, wholemeal bread, meat and others, vegetable and fruit. All portions adhere to HPB recommendations, and are priced at $1.50 for a medium portion and $2.00 for a large portion.

Through our participation in this programme, we hope that our Anthonians will benefit from well-balanced meals and cultivate healthy eating habits from young.
