Vision     | Technologically Empowered to Live and Learn | 
Mission   | Cultivate a&nbsp;Safe&nbsp;Learning Environment where Anthonians are Empowered to Embrace ICT&nbsp;in order to Enhance&nbsp;Learning, Encourage&nbsp;Collaboration&nbsp;and Support&nbsp;Self-Directed Learning.

As the use of ICT becomes more essential in learning, life and work, SAPS aims to equip students with the necessary skills, values and dispositions to navigate and optimise ICT affordances with confidence and discernment. The school incorporates MOE’s baseline ICT skills into our curriculum to better support students’ learning with and through technology. Through this, we hope to facilitate Anthonians’ acquisition of basic ICT skills to enhance the quality of their learning and increase their engagement and motivation to learn.

### Key Programmes

#### Cyber Wellness

At SAPS, we believe that anyone can be the first line of defence against threats in the digital domain. In alignment with MOE Cyber Wellness principles of Respect for Self &amp; Others, Safe &amp; Responsible Use, and Positive Peer Influence, the school’s cyber wellness programme adopts an inquiry-based approach towards helping Anthonians become responsible and discerning digital users who advocate healthy cyberspace activities.&nbsp;

  
The SAPS cyber wellness programme includes the following:

● Maintaining netiquette

● Recognising and preventing dangerous cyberspace encounters

● Overcoming gaming addiction

● Stopping cyberbullying

Through sharing sessions by the school’s CyTech champions and cyber wellness assembly programmes, the cyber wellness team continues to surface real-life case studies and promptly share learning points with the rest of the school community. We hope to continue empowering Anthonians to uplift and support one another in our efforts to promote positive and safe cyberspace experiences for all.

_Cyber wellness messages are included in the morning assembly slides to serve as daily reminders to our Anthonians as they engage in activities online._

#### Working Hand in Hand with Parents
We work with parents to ensure that our Anthonians are safe online. The Cybites section, featured in every alternate month’s Anthonian Updates newsletter, discusses current cyber wellness issues and shares tips on promoting healthy cyber activities at home.
