## Education Technology 

**<center>Mission</center>**

<center>Cultivate a Safe Learning Environment where Anthonians are Empowered to Embrace ICT  in order to Enhance Learning, Encourage Collaboration and Support Self-Directed Learning</center>

**<center>Vision</center>**

<center>Technologically Empowered to Live and Learn</center>

As the use of ICT becomes more essential in learning, life and work, SAPS aims to equip students with the necessary skills, values and dispositions to navigate and optimise ICT affordances with confidence and discernment. The school incorporates MOE’s baseline ICT skills into our curriculum to better support students’ learning with and through technology. Through this, we hope to facilitate Anthonians’ acquisition of basic ICT skills to enhance the quality of their learning and increase their engagement and motivation to learn.

### Key Programmes


Cyber Wellness

  

At SAPS, we believe that anyone can be the first line of defence against threats in the digital domain. In alignment with MOE Cyber Wellness principles of Respect for Self & Others, Safe & Responsible Use, and Positive Peer Influence, the school’s cyber wellness programme adopts an inquiry-based approach towards helping Anthonians become responsible and discerning digital users who advocate healthy cyberspace activities. 

  

The SAPS cyber wellness programme includes the following:

● Maintaining netiquette

● Recognising and preventing dangerous cyberspace encounters

● Overcoming gaming addiction

● Stopping cyberbullying

Through sharing sessions by the school’s Cyber-Smart ICT (CSI) ambassadors and cyber wellness messages assembly programmes, the cyber wellness team continues to surface real-life case studies and promptly share learning points with the rest of the school community. We hope to continue empowering Anthonians to uplift and support one another in our efforts to promote positive and safe cyberspace experiences for all.

Cyber wellness messages are included in the morning assembly slides to serve as daily reminders to our Anthonians as they engage in activities online.
