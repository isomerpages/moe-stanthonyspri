## Science

  
### Department Vision

To equip Anthonians with scientific knowledge, skills & attitudes to prepare them for life and work in the 21st Century. 

  

**Environmental Education (EE) Vision:** To instill care, respect and responsibility for the environment in every learner.

  

**Our teaching and learning approach**

In nurturing caring, passionate and joyful learners, in SAPS, we customise and design programmes and lessons drawing reference from the SAPS Teaching and Learning Framework and the syllabus guide provided by MOE.

Values, ethics and attitudes are cultivated through exploring social and ethical issues related to the application of Science, and by providing authentic teaching and learning experiences that incorporate SAPS Social Teaching (SST).

Progression of Curriculum across level
--------------------------------------

The department uses the following key strategies to support all Anthonians in learning knowledge and skills in Science through inquiry:

1.  The AAPOC (Aim, Apparatus, Procedure, Observation and Conclusion) approach to guide in the design and conduct of investigation and testing solution; and analysing and interpreting data
2.  CER (Claim, Evidence, Reason) in constructing clear explanations and reasoning.  
    This strengthens pupils’ ability to communicate their reasoning in a clear and logical manner, in alignment with 21CC.
3.  Inquiry-based learning and questioning techniques to allow pupils to appreciate how scientific knowledge is generated, and to help in the development of pupils’ interests, strengths and passion for learning.

  

Taking reference from the MOE Primary Science Syllabus, these strategies aim to develop in our Anthonians strong fundamentals in scientific knowledge, attitudes and values to enable them to learn how to learn Science in SAPS and beyond.

The Primary Science Syllabus follows a spiral approach, based on five themes that pupils can relate to in their everyday experiences, commonly observed phenomena in nature. The themes are revisited at different levels and with increasing depth to match pupils’ cognitive development. 

### Environmental Education (EE)  Key Programmes


**Values in Action (VIA)**

  

Values in Action (VIA) aims to nurture pupils’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA is designed to develop in pupils a sense of ownership and initiative. To nurture socially responsible citizens who apply their learning in Science to contribute meaningfully to the community, the Science Department engages our Anthonians in VIA every year, through our Environmental Education (EE) programme. 

  


**● P1 and P2 VIA: A Litter-free School Community** 

  

Our P1 and P2 Anthonians took part in a VIA project where they helped to keep the canteen tables and classrooms clean and tidy. This ensured that their peers could enjoy a clean environment. Through this project, our P1 and P2 Anthonians developed a sense of responsibility and learnt to be considerate to others. At the end of the project, they reflected on the goals they had set and how far they had come. In addition, they expressed their thoughts by drawing and writing about how they can apply the values learnt through this project in their daily life.
