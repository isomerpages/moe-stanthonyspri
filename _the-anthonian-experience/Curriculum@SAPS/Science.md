Vision     |  To equip Anthonians with scientific knowledge, skills &amp; attitudes to prepare them for life and work in the 21st Century
| | | 

**Our teaching and learning approach**

In nurturing caring, passionate and joyful learners, in SAPS, we customise and design programmes and lessons drawing reference from the SAPS Teaching and Learning Framework and the syllabus guide provided by MOE.

Values, ethics and attitudes are cultivated through exploring social and ethical issues related to the application of Science, and by providing authentic teaching and learning experiences that incorporate SAPS Social Teaching (SST).

### Progression of Curriculum across level

The department uses the following key strategies to support all Anthonians in learning knowledge and skills in Science through inquiry:

a\.  The AAPOC (Aim, Apparatus, Procedure, Observation and Conclusion) approach to guide in the design and conduct of investigation and testing solution; and analysing and interpreting data

b\. CER (Claim, Evidence, Reason) in constructing clear explanations and reasoning.  
    This strengthens pupils’ ability to communicate their reasoning in a clear and logical manner, in alignment with 21CC.

c\. Inquiry-based learning and questioning techniques to allow pupils to appreciate how scientific knowledge is generated, and to help in the development of pupils’ interests, strengths and passion for learning.

  

Taking reference from the MOE Primary Science Syllabus, these strategies aim to develop in our Anthonians strong fundamentals in scientific knowledge, attitudes and values to enable them to learn how to learn Science in SAPS and beyond.

The Primary Science Syllabus follows a spiral approach, based on five themes that pupils can relate to in their everyday experiences, commonly observed phenomena in nature. The themes are revisited at different levels and with increasing depth to match pupils’ cognitive development.&nbsp;



### Science Curriculum Programmes

**P1 and P2 Trail @ SAPS**

To arouse students’ interest in Science, an exciting and enriching experiential garden trail to SAPS Science Learning Hub was designed for our Primary 1 and Primary 2 Anthonians to learn more about plants.

The garden trail was integrated with Social Studies for Primary 1 and Programme Active Learning for Primary 2. Through the trail,&nbsp;Primary 1 pupils get to interact with the nature&nbsp;and to observe garden&nbsp;etiquettes&nbsp;while the Primary 2 pupils identify&nbsp;the different&nbsp;types of leaves.&nbsp;

Using their senses, they got to see, smell, feel and touch the different plants in the garden. They had the opportunity to take a closer look at the different parts of plants and garden wildlife such as snails and insects. They had a great time going outdoor exploring the gardens!

**P3 and P5 Digital Trail @ SAPS**

Our P3 and P5 Anthonians took to the Native Garden to learn more about our local plants. Our little botanists got their hands dirty - observing, smelling and touching various parts of the plants.

Through this hands-on learning approach, Anthonians were immersed in nature, experiencing first-hand the diversity of the natural eco-system. The first part of the experience included a teacher-guided tour of the garden. Anthonians were introduced to the plants and their parts.&nbsp;

They saw that there were different types of plants and observed animals such as ants and caterpillars at work in the garden. They saw how these animals relied on plants for food (leaves and nectar) and shelter. Our Anthonians saw their textbook come alive through this eye-opening experience.&nbsp;

In the second part of the lesson, Anthonians had to scan the QR code of each plant with their iPads in order to access information and complete the tasks assigned. The lesson was without doubt a memorable and enjoyable one for them.

**Enrichment Programmes**


The following programmes are organised to hone in students a keener interest in passion for learning Science:&nbsp;

*   Science Buskers 2023
*   E2K Science Programme
*   Nobel Summer Workshop and Mcurie Workshop organised by NUS High School

**Science Buskers 2023**

Our P3s, P4s and P5s Anthonians participated in the 2023 Science Buskers Competition organised by the Singapore Science Centre. 

This competition aims to promote the learning of Science in an engaging way and to generate greater interest in creative science communications and expressions. 

One of the P4 teams advanced into the final round. They did a Science Busking on, 'Magic soap and Floating lemon' at the Sengkang Grand Mall to the judges and public on 28 and 29 October. 

Anthonians who participated had a fun and enriching learning experience!

Well done Anthonians!

**E2K Science Programme**
  

The E2K Science Programme offers opportunities for Anthonians to engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts through inquiry. Every year, P4 to P6 Anthonians with an interest in and aptitude for Science are invited to participate in this programme. The rich learning experiences of the programmes help&nbsp;Anthonians to:
 

*   Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess; and
*   Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills.
