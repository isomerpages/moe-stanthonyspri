## Science

|  |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
Vision     |  To equip Anthonians with scientific knowledge, skills &amp; attitudes to prepare them for life and work in the 21st Century
| | | 


**Environmental Education (EE) Vision:**&nbsp;To instill care, respect and responsibility for the environment in every learner.

  

**Our teaching and learning approach**

In nurturing caring, passionate and joyful learners, in SAPS, we customise and design programmes and lessons drawing reference from the SAPS Teaching and Learning Framework and the syllabus guide provided by MOE.

Values, ethics and attitudes are cultivated through exploring social and ethical issues related to the application of Science, and by providing authentic teaching and learning experiences that incorporate SAPS Social Teaching (SST).

### Progression of Curriculum across level

The department uses the following key strategies to support all Anthonians in learning knowledge and skills in Science through inquiry:

a\.  The AAPOC (Aim, Apparatus, Procedure, Observation and Conclusion) approach to guide in the design and conduct of investigation and testing solution; and analysing and interpreting data

b\. CER (Claim, Evidence, Reason) in constructing clear explanations and reasoning.  
    This strengthens pupilsâ€™ ability to communicate their reasoning in a clear and logical manner, in alignment with 21CC.

c\. Inquiry-based learning and questioning techniques to allow pupils to appreciate how scientific knowledge is generated, and to help in the development of pupilsâ€™ interests, strengths and passion for learning.

  

Taking reference from the MOE Primary Science Syllabus, these strategies aim to develop in our Anthonians strong fundamentals in scientific knowledge, attitudes and values to enable them to learn how to learn Science in SAPS and beyond.

The Primary Science Syllabus follows a spiral approach, based on five themes that pupils can relate to in their everyday experiences, commonly observed phenomena in nature. The themes are revisited at different levels and with increasing depth to match pupilsâ€™ cognitive development.&nbsp;

### Environmental Education (EE)&nbsp; Key Programmes

**Environmental Education Activities**
  

St. Anthonyâ€™s Primary School envisions every Anthonian to be an advocate of green living. Anthonians will be committed to caring and protecting their environment by practicing good and friendly green habits as responsible citizens. Environmental Education (EE) in St. Anthonyâ€™s Primary School adopts a whole school approach, to reach out to all staff and pupils to care for the environment as well as to raise awareness and understand current environmental issues.


**World Water Day activities**

On 22 March, SAPS celebrated World Water Day with a series activities lined up for staff and students. Staff came to school dressed in blue to support the #GoBlue4SG movement by PUB. Anthonians learned about water-saving tips and water footprint through fun and games. One of the stations featured a tossing game made out of recyclables which was designed and made by our Environmental Science Club members. Other than recess activities, there are ongoing Water Wednesdays activities in class and on SLS where Anthonians learn more about the importance of water security and the need to protect our water resources. We encourage everyone to continue to use water wisely and make every drop ðŸ’§count.

**Earth Hour**

On 24 March 2023, our school showed our support for the Earth Hour movement by switching off half the number of lights and fans for half an hour in our classrooms.&nbsp;This is to raise awareness on how we can play our part, in large ways and small, to save our Earth.&nbsp;The symbolic action of switching off lights&nbsp;shows our commitment to&nbsp;take climate actions to overcome the climate crisis. Every minute and every hour counts, letâ€™s continue to play our part!

 **Biodiversity Week @ SAPS**


The International Day for Biological Diversity is celebrated on 22 May. To commemorate this, SAPS organised a series of activities for the Anthonians. The Environmental Science Club members learnt about the biodiversity in Singapore and conducted a biodiversity audit at our school garden, contributing to the nationâ€™s data.

On 17 and 18 May, during recess activities, Anthonians used portable microscopes on iPads to learn about the plants and cells at microscopic level and did a scavenger hunt in our garden. Through this, they learnt about diverse biodiversity in a fun way.

Following that, the P3s and P4s CODE@SAPS programme allowed Anthonians to apply their learning on coding to create a prototype to protect our precious biodiversity.

From 14 to 25 of August 2023, SAPS took part in the Clean Plate Campaign organized by Food from the Heart Singapore. The&nbsp;Clean Plate Campaign&nbsp;emphasizes the importance of reducing food waste by creating awareness of the environmental and societal impact of food waste and instilling the habit of mindful eating. All Anthonians are encouraged to practice ordering just enough and to finish the food on their plate during recess. On a daily basis, with a clean plate or bowl, they can redeem a stamp from their classâ€™s Environmental Ambassadors, in exchange for a token at the end of the campaign.

### Science Curriculum Programmes

**P1 and P2 Trail @ SAPS**

To arouse studentsâ€™ interest in Science, an exciting and enriching experiential garden trail to SAPS Science Learning Hub was designed for our Primary 1 and Primary 2 Anthonians to learn more about plants.

The garden trail was integrated with Social Studies for Primary 1 and Programme Active Learning for Primary 2. Through the trail,&nbsp;Primary 1 pupils get to interact with the nature&nbsp;and to observe garden&nbsp;etiquettes&nbsp;while the Primary 2 pupils identify&nbsp;the different&nbsp;types of leaves.&nbsp;

Using their senses, they got to see, smell, feel and touch the different plants in the garden. They had the opportunity to take a closer look at the different parts of plants and garden wildlife such as snails and insects. They had a great time going outdoor exploring the gardens!

**P3 and P5 Digital Trail @ SAPS**

Our P3 and P5 Anthonians took to the Native Garden to learn more about our local plants. Our little botanists got their hands dirty - observing, smelling and touching various parts of the plants.

Through this hands-on learning approach, Anthonians were immersed in nature, experiencing first-hand the diversity of the natural eco-system. The first part of the experience included a teacher-guided tour of the garden. Anthonians were introduced to the plants and their parts.&nbsp;

They saw that there were different types of plants and observed animals such as ants and caterpillars at work in the garden. They saw how these animals relied on plants for food (leaves and nectar) and shelter. Our Anthonians saw their textbook come alive through this eye-opening experience.&nbsp;

In the second part of the lesson, Anthonians had to scan the QR code of each plant with their iPads in order to access information and complete the tasks assigned. The lesson was without doubt a memorable and enjoyable one for them.

**Enrichment Programmes**


The following programmes are organised to hone in students a keener interest in passion for learning Science:&nbsp;

*   Science Buskers 2023
*   E2K Science Programme
*   Nobel Summer Workshop and Mcurie Workshop organised by NUS High School

**Science Buskers 2023**

Our P3s, P4s and P5s Anthonians participated in the 2023 Science Buskers Competition organised by the Singapore Science Centre. 

This competition aims to promote the learning of Science in an engaging way and to generate greater interest in creative science communications and expressions. 

One of the P4 teams advanced into the final round. They did a Science Busking on, 'Magic soap and Floating lemon' at the Sengkang Grand Mall to the judges and public on 28 and 29 October. 

Anthonians who participated had a fun and enriching learning experience!

Well done Anthonians!

**E2K Science Programme**
  

The E2K Science Programme offers opportunities for Anthonians to engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts through inquiry. Every year, P4 to P6 Anthonians with an interest in and aptitude for Science are invited to participate in this programme. The rich learning experiences of the programmes help&nbsp;Anthonians to:
 

*   Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess; and.-
*   Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills.
