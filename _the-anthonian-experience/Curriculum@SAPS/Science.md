| -------- | -------- | 
Vision     |  To equip Anthonians with scientific knowledge, skills & attitudes to prepare them for life and work in the 21st Century
| | | 


**Environmental Education (EE) Vision:** To instill care, respect and responsibility for the environment in every learner.

  

**Our teaching and learning approach**

In nurturing caring, passionate and joyful learners, in SAPS, we customise and design programmes and lessons drawing reference from the SAPS Teaching and Learning Framework and the syllabus guide provided by MOE.

Values, ethics and attitudes are cultivated through exploring social and ethical issues related to the application of Science, and by providing authentic teaching and learning experiences that incorporate SAPS Social Teaching (SST).

### Progression of Curriculum across level

The department uses the following key strategies to support all Anthonians in learning knowledge and skills in Science through inquiry:

a\.  The AAPOC (Aim, Apparatus, Procedure, Observation and Conclusion) approach to guide in the design and conduct of investigation and testing solution; and analysing and interpreting data

b\. CER (Claim, Evidence, Reason) in constructing clear explanations and reasoning.  
    This strengthens pupils’ ability to communicate their reasoning in a clear and logical manner, in alignment with 21CC.

c\. Inquiry-based learning and questioning techniques to allow pupils to appreciate how scientific knowledge is generated, and to help in the development of pupils’ interests, strengths and passion for learning.

  

Taking reference from the MOE Primary Science Syllabus, these strategies aim to develop in our Anthonians strong fundamentals in scientific knowledge, attitudes and values to enable them to learn how to learn Science in SAPS and beyond.

The Primary Science Syllabus follows a spiral approach, based on five themes that pupils can relate to in their everyday experiences, commonly observed phenomena in nature. The themes are revisited at different levels and with increasing depth to match pupils’ cognitive development. 

### Environmental Education (EE)  Key Programmes


**Values in Action (VIA)**

  

Values in Action (VIA) aims to nurture pupils’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA is designed to develop in pupils a sense of ownership and initiative. To nurture socially responsible citizens who apply their learning in Science to contribute meaningfully to the community, the Science Department engages our Anthonians in VIA every year, through our Environmental Education (EE) programme. 

  


**P1 and P2 VIA: A Litter-free School Community**

  

Our P1 and P2 Anthonians took part in a VIA project where they helped to keep the canteen tables and classrooms clean and tidy. This ensured that their peers could enjoy a clean environment. Through this project, our P1 and P2 Anthonians developed a sense of responsibility and learnt to be considerate to others. At the end of the project, they reflected on the goals they had set and how far they had come. In addition, they expressed their thoughts by drawing and writing about how they can apply the values learnt through this project in their daily life.

**P3 VIA: A Litter-free School Community** 

  

The P3 VIA this year was based on the theme - ‘A Litter-Free School Compound'. Anthonians started their VIA by completing a checklist to identify the areas in the school which needed improvement. Based on their observations, they suggested ways to improve the cleanliness of the areas identified. Each class then adopted an area in the school to take care of and designed posters to advocate cleanliness. Through this VIA, P3 Anthonians learnt to be responsible by taking ownership and care of their school compound. They also reflected on their VIA and learnt to be respectful and grateful to our school cleaning staff. Our P3 Anthonians have become resilient advocates for a litter-free environment to their peers.

**P4 VIA: Stop Food Wastage**

Our P4 Anthonians played an active role educating all P1 Anthonians not to waste food unnecessarily. In addition, the P4 Anthonians shared important messages on food waste reduction with their family members and encouraged more parents to play their part in reducing food wastage through committing to a family pledge. They also organised the collection of fruit peels from home and in school for composting which was then used as fertilisers in the school garden. Through this VIA, our P4 Anthonians learnt about community issues and the needs of others, and sought to reach out to their peers in school as well as the larger community to spread the important message of reducing food wastage.

**P5 VIA: A Litter-free environment**

  

Our P5 Anthonians focused on advocating clean environment. Through brainstorming, our Anthonians identified that littering is the main problem in Singapore. Littering not only brings about air, water and land pollution, but also causes pest infestations which can lead to the spread of diseases.

In light of the COVID 19 pandemic, the P5 Anthonians reached out to their peers in school this year instead of promoting their message to residents in the neighbourhood. They shared with their peers ways to encourage everyone to take responsibility for our actions and show more care for our environment by keeping it clean.

**Outreach Programme - Dengue Sharing**

Our Environmental Ambassadors attended an online course conducted by NEA during the June holidays on the prevention of dengue. During the course, the ambassadors explored creative ways to share their message with the rest of the school. 

During a pre-assembly talk, the ambassadors shared with their peers what dengue is, its symptoms and ways how we can prevent the breeding of mosquitoes at home. Anthonians learned that everyone has a part to play in preventing the spread of dengue.

Together, we can fight dengue and keep our family members, neighbours and community safe.

**Biodiversity Week** 

  

During Biodiversity Week, our P1 and P2 pupils learnt about flora and fauna native to Singapore. They explored an interactive activity book and viewed a short animated video that follows Bobby and Stella on their journey to find a place to grow a seed. Through this activity, our Anthonians gained a better appreciation of biodiversity and became more aware of the need to conserve nature. They developed a deeper understanding of the world around them and found out how things work through simple investigations. Overall, it was a fun and enriching learning experience for them.

**Reduce Carbon foodprint @ SAPS**

Our carbon footprint has a negative impact on the environment, and it contributes to climate change. The Environmental Science Club at SAPS embarked on a School for Climate Action with the World Wide Fund For Nature. The aim was to educate the school population on carbon footprint and encourage them to take action to reduce their carbon footprint by making “environmentally-friendly” choices. 

Members of the Environmental Science Club attended workshop conducted by WWF to learn more about climate change and the different contributors of carbon footprint. After the workshop, the members initiated and planned activities to raise awareness about the issues to encourage their peers to reduce their carbon footprint. Some of the activities conducted are pre-assembly talks, skits and use of billboards during recesses to create awareness. On top of these, a lesson on carbon footprint was designed and conducted during TACT. It was such an enriching experience for the school.

**Clean Plate Campaign**

The world is producing more food than we can finish. Yet, it is unevenly distributed, with the poor going hungry while food is being thrown away elsewhere. The importance of reducing food wastage is taught and emphasised across all levels in SAPS. Through the Clean Plate Campaign, each Anthonian is strongly encouraged to order only what they can finish so as to reduce food waste. In SAPS, we also have Food Waste Ambassadors to help to monitor food wastage during recess.

### Science Curriculum Programmes

**P1 and P2 Trail @ SAPS**

To arouse students’ interest in Science, an exciting and enriching experiential garden trail to SAPS Science Learning Hub was designed for our Primary 1 and Primary 2 Anthonians to learn more about plants.

The garden trail was integrated with Social Studies for Primary 1 and Programme Active Learning for Primary 2. Through the trail, Primary 1 pupils get to interact with the nature and to observe garden etiquettes while the Primary 2 identify the different types of leaves. 

Using their senses, they got to see, smell, feel and touch the different plants in the garden. They had the opportunity to take a closer look at the different parts of plants and garden wildlife such as snails and insects. They had a great time going outdoor exploring the gardens!

**P3 and P5 Digital Trail @ SAPS**

Our P3 and P5 Anthonians took to the Native Garden to learn more about our local plants. Our little botanists got their hands dirty - observing, smelling and touching various parts of the plants.

Through this hands-on learning approach, Anthonians were immersed in nature, experiencing first-hand the diversity of the natural eco-system. The first part of the experience included a teacher-guided tour of the garden. Anthonians were introduced to the plants and their parts. 

They saw that there were different types of plants and observed animals such as ants and caterpillars at work in the garden. They saw how these animals relied on plants for food (leaves and nectar) and shelter. Our Anthonians saw their textbook come alive through this eye-opening experience. 

In the second part of the lesson, Anthonians had to scan the QR code of each plant with their iPads in order to access information and complete the tasks assigned. The lesson was without doubt a memorable and enjoyable one for them.
