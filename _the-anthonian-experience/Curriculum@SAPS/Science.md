## Science

  
### Department Vision

To equip Anthonians with scientific knowledge, skills & attitudes to prepare them for life and work in the 21st Century. 

  

**Environmental Education (EE) Vision:** To instill care, respect and responsibility for the environment in every learner.

  

**Our teaching and learning approach**

In nurturing caring, passionate and joyful learners, in SAPS, we customise and design programmes and lessons drawing reference from the SAPS Teaching and Learning Framework and the syllabus guide provided by MOE.

Values, ethics and attitudes are cultivated through exploring social and ethical issues related to the application of Science, and by providing authentic teaching and learning experiences that incorporate SAPS Social Teaching (SST).

### Progression of Curriculum across level

The department uses the following key strategies to support all Anthonians in learning knowledge and skills in Science through inquiry:

a\.  The AAPOC (Aim, Apparatus, Procedure, Observation and Conclusion) approach to guide in the design and conduct of investigation and testing solution; and analysing and interpreting data

b\. CER (Claim, Evidence, Reason) in constructing clear explanations and reasoning.  
    This strengthens pupils’ ability to communicate their reasoning in a clear and logical manner, in alignment with 21CC.

c\. Inquiry-based learning and questioning techniques to allow pupils to appreciate how scientific knowledge is generated, and to help in the development of pupils’ interests, strengths and passion for learning.

  

Taking reference from the MOE Primary Science Syllabus, these strategies aim to develop in our Anthonians strong fundamentals in scientific knowledge, attitudes and values to enable them to learn how to learn Science in SAPS and beyond.

The Primary Science Syllabus follows a spiral approach, based on five themes that pupils can relate to in their everyday experiences, commonly observed phenomena in nature. The themes are revisited at different levels and with increasing depth to match pupils’ cognitive development. 

### Environmental Education (EE)  Key Programmes


**Values in Action (VIA)**

  

Values in Action (VIA) aims to nurture pupils’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA is designed to develop in pupils a sense of ownership and initiative. To nurture socially responsible citizens who apply their learning in Science to contribute meaningfully to the community, the Science Department engages our Anthonians in VIA every year, through our Environmental Education (EE) programme. 

  


**● P1 and P2 VIA: A Litter-free School Community**

  

Our P1 and P2 Anthonians took part in a VIA project where they helped to keep the canteen tables and classrooms clean and tidy. This ensured that their peers could enjoy a clean environment. Through this project, our P1 and P2 Anthonians developed a sense of responsibility and learnt to be considerate to others. At the end of the project, they reflected on the goals they had set and how far they had come. In addition, they expressed their thoughts by drawing and writing about how they can apply the values learnt through this project in their daily life.

**● P3 VIA: A Litter-free School Community** 

  

The P3 VIA this year was based on the theme - ‘A Litter-Free School Compound'. Anthonians started their VIA by completing a checklist to identify the areas in the school which needed improvement. Based on their observations, they suggested ways to improve the cleanliness of the areas identified. Each class then adopted an area in the school to take care of and designed posters to advocate cleanliness. Through this VIA, P3 Anthonians learnt to be responsible by taking ownership and care of their school compound. They also reflected on their VIA and learnt to be respectful and grateful to our school cleaning staff. Our P3 Anthonians have become resilient advocates for a litter-free environment to their peers.

**● P4 VIA: Stop Food Wastage**

Our P4 Anthonians played an active role educating all P1 Anthonians not to waste food unnecessarily. In addition, the P4 Anthonians shared important messages on food waste reduction with their family members and encouraged more parents to play their part in reducing food wastage through committing to a family pledge. They also organised the collection of fruit peels from home and in school for composting which was then used as fertilisers in the school garden. Through this VIA, our P4 Anthonians learnt about community issues and the needs of others, and sought to reach out to their peers in school as well as the larger community to spread the important message of reducing food wastage.

**P5 VIA: A Litter-free environment**

  

Our P5 Anthonians focused on advocating clean environment. Through brainstorming, our Anthonians identified that littering is the main problem in Singapore. Littering not only brings about air, water and land pollution, but also causes pest infestations which can lead to the spread of diseases.

In light of the COVID 19 pandemic, the P5 Anthonians reached out to their peers in school this year instead of promoting their message to residents in the neighbourhood. They shared with their peers ways to encourage everyone to take responsibility for our actions and show more care for our environment by keeping it clean.

**Outreach Programme - Dengue Sharing**

  

Our Environmental Ambassadors attended an online course conducted by NEA during the June holidays on the prevention of dengue. During the course, the ambassadors explored creative ways to share their message with the rest of the school. 

During a pre-assembly talk, the ambassadors shared with their peers what dengue is, its symptoms and ways how we can prevent the breeding of mosquitoes at home. Anthonians learned that everyone has a part to play in preventing the spread of dengue.

Together, we can fight dengue and keep our family members, neighbours and community safe.

**Biodiversity Week** 

  

During Biodiversity Week, our P1 and P2 pupils learnt about flora and fauna native to Singapore. They explored an interactive activity book and viewed a short animated video that follows Bobby and Stella on their journey to find a place to grow a seed. Through this activity, our Anthonians gained a better appreciation of biodiversity and became more aware of the need to conserve nature. They developed a deeper understanding of the world around them and found out how things work through simple investigations. Overall, it was a fun and enriching learning experience for them.
