## Pupils Discipline & Leadership

| -------- | -------- |
| Vision     | Every Anthonian makes the right decisions based on Lasallian and Anthonian values and is a leader who steps forward to serve with pride.   |

  **Learning to Live Well Programme and Whole-School Approach to Discipline**  

The school uses a Positive and Proactive Approach to Discipline to reinforce expected behaviour. School routines like F.I.V.E, Anthonian Movement, STAR and CARE Habits are emphasised and reinforced throughout a student’s journey in SAPS.

  

*   **CARE Quest (CQ) Award to Promote Positive Behaviour** 

CARE Quest recognizes students who exemplify the Lasallian Values (Faith, Service, Community) and are anchored in Anthonian Values (Resilience, Integrity, Gratitude, Respect, Responsibility). 

  

*   **Anthonian Suggestion Scheme: Anthonian Matters!** 

_The Anthonian Matters_ scheme provides opportunities for students to be a blessing to the school community by involving them in decision-making processes and developing in them a sense of pride, belonging and ownership to school.

  

*   **Anthonian Leadership Programme**

Student Leadership Development (SLD) in SAPS is guided by the belief that every student can be developed as a leader. Recognising that student leadership development needs to be intentional, we are guided by the following principles:

  

**Student-centric**

Programmes are customised to cater to diverse and unique student profiles for holistic leadership development. Intended outcomes take reference from the 21CC Framework of Core Values as well Social & Emotional competencies. 

  

**Values-driven**

We recognised the importance of grounding leadership in sound values (Lasallian and Anthonian values) to enable student leaders to lead others to achieve goals in an ethical manner.

  

**Sustained and coherent** 

Key messages and themes relating to student leadership are consistently reinforced and incorporated in the curriculum and co-curriculum.

  

**Tiered**

To develop the leadership capacity of every Anthonian, all our students undergo baseline leadership development with opportunities for advanced development for students with greater interest and/or potential.
