</div>
<p>Rooted in our Lasallian ethos, our Visual Arts Learning for Life Programme
(LLP) aims to cultivate in our students a desire to&nbsp;<strong>expl</strong>ore
artistic forms and methods,&nbsp;<strong>foster</strong>&nbsp;an appreciation
of art, and&nbsp;<strong>serve</strong>&nbsp;the community with their talents.</p>
<p><strong>LEARN</strong>
<br><em>Learning to appreciate and create art</em>
</p>
<p>The Tier 1 programme is incorporated in the school’s Visual Arts (VA)
curriculum for all students. As an enhancement to the curriculum, students
learn specialised art forms through Digital Art and Ceramics modules from
P1 to P6, which strengthen students’ skills progressively.</p>

<p><strong><em>&nbsp;Digital Art Programme</em></strong>
</p>
<p>In our Digital Art programme, Anthonians harness technology to bring their
creative visions to life, progressing from basic tools to creating sophisticated
static and animated artworks. Through this journey, they develop both artistic
skills and digital literacy, learning to navigate the digital creative
space responsibly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Ceramics Programme</em></strong>
</p>
<p>In this programme, students discover the joy of working with clay, transforming
raw materials into unique artistic expressions through various hand-building
techniques. Their ceramic creations proudly adorn our school spaces, celebrating
their artistic achievements and inspiring others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Think! Contemporary</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Think! Contemporary is a multi-visit, museum-based school programme for
our P4 cohort. It integrates the school’s VA curriculum with museum visits
and uses artwork from the Singapore Art Museum’s (SAM) permanent collection
as primary resources for art lessons to provide an authentic experience
in the appreciation and creation of art.</p>

<p><strong>GROW</strong>
<br><em>Deepening interest, appreciation and aptitude</em>
</p>
<p>Students who have greater interest or aptitude in VA are encouraged to
participate in our Tier 2 programmes to deepen their interest, broaden
their horizons and hone their talents.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>CCAs: Junior &amp; Senior Art Club</em></strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture13.png">
</div>
<p>The school offers CCAs for students with a keen interest in VA. The Junior
Art Club caters to P1-P3 students, while the Senior Art Club comprises
P4-P6 students. While the focus is on ceramics, Art Club members also get
to explore varied techniques, forms and mediums to express their creativity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>School-based Art Elective Programme</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s own AEP was piloted for P2 in 2008 and has since expanded
to include P2 to P6 Anthonians. Students enjoy opportunities to explore
different art mediums through specialised modules, such as printmaking,
still-life drawing, observational drawing and papier-mâché.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>SERVE</strong>
<br><em>Being a blessing to the community</em>
</p>
<p>Arts Reach is the school’s outreach to the community through the arts.&nbsp;
In line with our Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community, Arts
Reach gives Anthonians opportunities to use the skills they learn in the
school’s VA programmes to bless those in the wider community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Visiting residents at care centres</em></strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture16.jpg">
</div>
<p>Students visit elderly residents at Hong Kah North Day Care Centre and
St. Luke’s ElderCare Centre to guide them through art activities and give
them artwork made by Anthonians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Hosting art classes for seniors</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SAPS supports Family Central’s Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP),
which encourages seniors to sign up for courses. SAPS conducts Ceramics
workshops for interested seniors, with Senior Art Club members guiding
them through the process. The experience also provides rich opportunities
for Anthonians to interact with and learn from the seniors, and reinforces
the idea that learning is a joyful and lifelong process.</p>
