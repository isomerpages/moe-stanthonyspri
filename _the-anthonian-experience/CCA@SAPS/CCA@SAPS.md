<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part of a student’s school
experience. At SAPS, our CCA programme is guided by the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To enable Anthonians to strengthen their character and embody the school’s
vision of being the best that they can be, to make the world a better place
through active CCA involvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support the development of non-academic knowledge, skills, values,
and attitudes in our students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CCAs are designed to focus on the development of specific knowledge, skills,
and values aligned with the student’s selected CCA. Participation in a
CCA enables students to explore their interests and talents while also
offering opportunities to build lasting friendships across diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>Our CCA programme provides rich opportunities for authentic and experiential
learning. Through CCA participation, Anthonians will develop and demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Passion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership and teamwork</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friendship and a sense of belonging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A spirit of service to the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge, skills, and values related to their chosen CCA, which allow
them to experience personal accomplishment and success</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core values, social and emotional competencies, and 21st-century competencies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school offers the following CCAs:</p>
