## CCA@SAPS

Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part of a student’s schooling life. At SAPS, our CCAs are guided by the following objectives:

1) Anthonians strengthen their character and live out the school vision of being the best that they can be to make the world a better place through their CCA involvement.

2) Anthonians develop non-academic knowledge, skills, values and attitudes.

  

Co-Curricular Activities focus on the development of specific knowledge, skills and values based on the student’s choice of CCA. Participating in a CCA enables students to discover their interests and talents while providing a platform for students from diverse backgrounds to interact and form lasting friendships. 

  

CCAs provide many opportunities for authentic and experiential learning. Through CCA participation, Anthonians will develop and demonstrate: 

*   passion
*   leadership and teamwork
*   friendship and belonging
*   a spirit of service to the community
*   knowledge, skills and values related to their chosen CCA, which allow students to experience accomplishment and success
*   core values, social and emotional competencies and 21st century competencies

The school offers the following CCAs:
