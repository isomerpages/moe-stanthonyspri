<p><strong>All Primary 2 to 6 students are strongly encouraged to participate in one Co-Curricular Activity (CCA).</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility for a Second CCA</strong>
<br>Students may take up a second CCA only if the following conditions are
met:</p>
<p>They have maintained good attendance in their first CCA (at least 80%).</p>
<p>Parental permission has been granted.</p>
<p>There is a vacancy in the second CCA.</p>
<p>The schedules of both CCAs do not clash (i.e. practices or events are
not conducted concurrently).</p>
<p>Their participation does not affect their academic performance.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance Requirements</strong>
<br>All CCA members are expected to attend training sessions on a regular
basis. A minimum attendance of 80% per semester is required.</p>
<p>Students will not be penalised for absences due to valid reasons. A letter
of excuse or a medical certificate must be submitted to account for any
absence. CCA membership and attendance will be reflected in the Results
Slip only if the student has attended at least 80% of the total number
of sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Active Participation</strong>
<br>Students should participate actively in their chosen CCA for a minimum
of one year.</p>
<p><strong>Attire</strong>
<br>For the safety of all students, appropriate attire must be worn during
CCA sessions.</p>
<p><strong>External CCAs and Achievements</strong>
<br>Students who have participated in CCAs, activities or competitions not
offered or organised by the school, or who have achieved outstanding results,
may inform the school of their involvement and accomplishments.</p>
<p><strong>CCA Application Process</strong>
<br>CCA applications will take place in October each year. CCA sessions will
commence in January the following year. Parents will be notified via Parents
Gateway.</p>
