*   To encourage students to use the knowledge gained from completing a mission to enhance their learning and problem solving skills in the classroom.

  

_**Activities:**_

*   Basic training programme where students are introduced to the concept of Robotics to build and program robots to perform simple tasks. 
*   Advanced training programme where students learn how to use sensors and other Lego components to carry out more complex tasks.
