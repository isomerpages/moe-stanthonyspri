## Visual Arts

The Visual Arts CCA runs two broad programmes, namely a Ceramics Programme and an Art Elective Programme. In each programme, teachers demonstrate the handling of materials and tools before students go through hands-on sessions where they explore and create works of art. CCA members will also undergo a digital art programme for one term. They will get the opportunity to create their own portfolios (sketchbook) and participate in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and PAssionArts exhibitions.
