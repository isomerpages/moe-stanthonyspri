### Applied Learning Programme


CODE@SAPS is a customised coding curriculum, specially designed for Primary 3 to Primary 5 Anthonians, to equip them with the fundamentals of computational thinking, inventive thinking and critical thinking skills. 

  

The programme provides opportunities for students to acquire 21st Century Competencies and experience the joy of learning for life beyond academic pursuits to become confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens.   

  

**<u>Key Programmes</u>**

  

**Coding Curriculum** 

Primary 3 students learn basic programming concepts through the use of colour codes and visual programming with an Ozobot. They apply the codes learnt by programming the movements of the Ozobot to solve puzzles, navigate mazes and develop debugging skills (identifying and rectifying errors through logical thinking).

  

Primary 4 and 5 students learn block coding with a Micro:bit, which is a pocket-sized, codeable computer. They apply the codes learnt by devising coding-based solutions to a given problem. This project helps students to consolidate their learning of the various coding skills and apply them to a real-life situation. Some examples of projects include: 

*   creating a prototype using micro:bit to alert the residents and cleaners of stagnant water accumulating; and
*   creating a fall detection alarm system with micro:bit to inform caregivers when seniors injure themselves at home.
