<h3>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</h3>
<p>ALP@SAPS is a customised curriculum, specially designed for Primary 1
to Primary 6 Anthonians, to equip them with the fundamentals of computational
thinking, inventive thinking and critical thinking skills through Coding
and Makerspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme provides opportunities for students to acquire 21st-century
competencies and experience the joy of learning for life, extending beyond
academic pursuits to become confident individuals, self-directed learners,
active contributors, and concerned citizens.</p>

<p>Across all programmes, the school adopts the “FEEL, IMAGINE, DO, SHARE”
(FIDS) Framework to encourage our students to empathise with others and
to believe that they can make a difference in their own ways.</p>
<p><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Young Coders</strong>
</p>
<p>Anthonians start young on the learning of basic computational thinking.
In this programme, the Primary 1 Anthonians learn basic programming concepts
through the use of colour codes (a series of colors that tell the robot
what to do) with an Ozobot in the Young Coders programme. Anthonians drew
lines and added colour codes to tell the Ozobot what turns to take and
what decisions to make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on the basic programming concepts that they learnt in Primary
1, Primary 2 Anthonians learn programming concepts through visual programming
with Ozobots and Quarky too. They apply block-based codes through an app
to programme the movements of the Quarky to solve puzzles, navigate mazes
and develop debugging skills.</p>

<p><strong>Aspiring Inventors</strong>
</p>
<p>Aspiring Inventors were implemented as an avenue for students to come
together and solve problems through free play and making. These making
and tinkering practices encourage creative thinking amongst students as
they construct, deconstruct, design, fix, create and refine solutions to
various problems presented to them after going through the process of FIDS
thinking.</p>

<p>Students are able to take items apart, put things together, and dream
of imaginative creations. The notion of multiple attempts, refining designs,
and failure are all inherent with engaging students to take risks. This
is aligned to the school direction towards having a growth mindset.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Smart Thinkers</strong>
</p>
<p>In the Smart Thinkers programme, the application of “FEEL, IMAGINE, DO,
SHARE” is designed to prime Anthonians to think about problem solving in
an empathetic way; recognising them as capable young change makers. Primary
3 and 4 Anthonians learn block coding with a Microbit, which is a pocket-sized,
codeable computer. They also learnt about biodiversity, identified some
issues that they feel are problems, brainstormed solutions and built their
prototypes using Micro:bits. Likewise, Primary 5 Anthonians delve in CoSpaces
where they build digital interactive content. These projects help students
to consolidate their learning of the various coding skills and apply them
to a real-life situation.</p>

<p>At Primary 6, the students go through Coding classes as part of their
post PSLE+ activities, where they consolidate their learning and programme
Sphero bots to interact with each other via bluetooth and coding. They
are also introduced to what is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how we
teach an AI system such that it becomes more reliable.</p>
