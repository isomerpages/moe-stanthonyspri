## ALP@SAPS

### Applied Learning Programme


ALP@SAPS is a customised curriculum, specially designed for Primary 1 to Primary 6 Anthonians, to equip them with the fundamentals of computational thinking, inventive thinking and critical thinking skills through Coding and Makerspace.&nbsp;

  
The programme provides opportunities for students to acquire 21st Century Competencies and experience the joy of learning for life beyond academic pursuits to become confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens.

Across all programmes, the school adopts the “FEEL, IMAGINE, DO, SHARE” (FIDS) Framework to encourage our students to empathise with others and to believe that they can make a difference in their own ways.


**<u>Key Programmes</u>**

  

**Young Coders**


Anthonians start young on the learning of Basic Computation thinking. In this programme, the Primary 1 Anthonians learn basic programming concepts through the use of colour codes (a series of colors that tell the robot what to do) with an Ozobot in the Young Coders programme. Anthonians drew lines and added colour codes to tell the Ozobot what turns to take and what decisions to make.&nbsp;

 
Building on the basic programming concepts that they learnt in Primary 1, Primary 2 Anthonians learn programming concepts through visual programming with Ozobots and Quarky too. They apply block-based codes through an app to programme the movements of the Ozobots and Quarky to solve puzzles, navigate mazes and develop debugging skills (identifying and rectifying errors through logical thinking).



In the Smart Thinkers coding programme, Primary 4 and 5 students learn block coding with a Micro:bit, which is a pocket-sized, codeable computer. They apply the codes learnt by devising coding-based solutions to a given problem. This project helps students to consolidate their learning of the various coding skills and apply them to a real-life situation. Some examples of projects include:&nbsp;

*   creating prototypes for step tracker product to encourage Anthonians to be more physically active and prototypes of smart light product using micro:bit to reduce their carbon footprint.
*   creating prototypes of automatic watering system which can monitor the moisture content in the soil and automate the process of watering and prototypes of proximity beacon to prevent blind corner accidents.

**Maker@SAPS**

Maker@SAPS was implemented as an avenue for students to come together and solve problems through free play. These making and tinkering practices encourage creative thinking amongst students as they construct, deconstruct, design, fix, create and refine solutions to various problems presented to them.

Students are able to take items apart, put things together, and dream of imaginative creations. The notion of multiple attempts, refining designs, and failure are all inherent with engaging students to take risks. This is aligned to the school direction towards having a growth mindset.

Maker@SAPS is now incorporated into CCAs to encourage students to think out of the box to creatively solve problems and give them opportunities to discuss about emerging issues around the world.
