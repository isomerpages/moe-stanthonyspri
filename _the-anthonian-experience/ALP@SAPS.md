## ALP@SAPS

### Applied Learning Programme


CODE@SAPS is a customised coding curriculum, specially designed for Primary 2 to Primary 5 Anthonians, to equip them with the fundamentals of computational thinking, inventive thinking and critical thinking skills. 

  

The programme provides opportunities for students to acquire 21st Century Competencies and experience the joy of learning for life beyond academic pursuits to become confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens.   

  

**<u>Key Programmes</u>**

  

**Coding Curriculum** 

Primary 2 students learn basic programming concepts through the use of colour codes with an Ozobot in the Young Coders coding programme. Anthonians drew lines and added colour codes to tell the Ozobot what to do!

Also in the Young Coders programme, Primary 3 students learn learn basic programming concepts through the use of colour codes and visual programming with an Ozobot too.
They apply the codes learnt by programming the movements of the Ozobot to solve puzzles, navigate mazes and develop debugging skills (identifying and rectifying errors through logical thinking).


In the Smart Thinkers coding programme, Primary 4 and 5 students learn block coding with a Micro:bit, which is a pocket-sized, codeable computer. They apply the codes learnt by devising coding-based solutions to a given problem. This project helps students to consolidate their learning of the various coding skills and apply them to a real-life situation. Some examples of projects include: 

*   creating prototypes for step tracker product to encourage Anthonians to be more physically active and prototypes of smart light product using micro:bit to reduce their carbon footprint.
*   creating prototypes of automatic watering system which can monitor the moisture content in the soil and automate the process of watering and prototypes of proximity beacon to prevent blind corner accidents.

**Maker@SAPS**

Maker@SAPS was implemented as an avenue for students to come together and solve problems through free play. These making and tinkering practices encourage creative thinking amongst students as they construct, deconstruct, design, fix, create and refine solutions to various problems presented to them.

Students are able to take items apart, put things together, and dream of imaginative creations. The notion of multiple attempts, refining designs, and failure are all inherent with engaging students to take risks. This is aligned to the school direction towards having a growth mindset.

Maker@SAPS is now incorporated into CCAs to encourage students to think out of the box to creatively solve problems.
