## ALP@SAPS

### Applied Learning Programme


ALP@SAPS is a customised curriculum, specially designed for Primary 1 to Primary 6 Anthonians, to equip them with the fundamentals of computational thinking, inventive thinking and critical thinking skills through Coding and Makerspace.&nbsp;

  
The programme provides opportunities for students to acquire 21st Century Competencies and experience the joy of learning for life beyond academic pursuits to become confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens.

Across all programmes, the school adopts the “FEEL, IMAGINE, DO, SHARE” (FIDS) Framework to encourage our students to empathise with others and to believe that they can make a difference in their own ways.


**<u>Key Programmes</u>**

  
**Young Coders**


Anthonians start young on the learning of Basic Computation thinking. In this programme, the Primary 1 Anthonians learn basic programming concepts through the use of colour codes (a series of colors that tell the robot what to do) with an Ozobot in the Young Coders programme. Anthonians drew lines and added colour codes to tell the Ozobot what turns to take and what decisions to make.&nbsp;

 
Building on the basic programming concepts that they learnt in Primary 1, Primary 2 Anthonians learn programming concepts through visual programming with Ozobots and Quarky too. They apply block-based codes through an app to programme the movements of the Ozobots and Quarky to solve puzzles, navigate mazes and develop debugging skills (identifying and rectifying errors through logical thinking).

**Aspiring Inventors**


Aspiring Inventors were implemented as an avenue for students to come together and solve problems through free play and Making. These making and tinkering practices encourage creative thinking amongst students as they construct, deconstruct, design, fix, create and refine solutions to various problems presented to them after going through the process of FIDS thinking.

Students are able to take items apart, put things together, and dream of imaginative creations. The notion of multiple attempts, refining designs, and failure are all inherent with engaging students to take risks. This is aligned to the school direction towards having a growth mindset.&nbsp;

 
**Smart Thinkers**

 
In the Smart Thinkers programme, the application of “FEEL, IMAGINE, DO, SHARE” is designed to prime Anthonians to think about problem solving in an empathetic way; recognising them as capable young change makers. Primary 3 and 4 Anthonians learn block coding with a Micro:bit, which is a pocket-sized, codeable computer. They also learnt about biodiversity, identified some issues that they feel are problems, brainstormed solutions and built their prototypes using Micro:bits. Likewise, Primary 5 Anthonians delve in CoSpaces where they build digital interactive content. These projects help students to consolidate their learning of the various coding skills and apply them to a real-life situation.

At Primary 6, the students go through Coding classes as part of their post PSLE+ activities, where they consolidate their learning and programme Sphero bots to interact with each other via bluetooth and coding. They are also introduced to what is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how we teach an AI system such that it becomes more reliable.
