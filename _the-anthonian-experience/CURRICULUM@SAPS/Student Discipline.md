<p><strong>Anthonian Leadership Programme</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Student Leadership Development (SLD) in SAPS is guided by the belief that
every student can be developed as a leader. Recognising that student leadership
development needs to be intentional, we are guided by the following principles:</p>
<p><strong>Student-centric</strong>
</p>
<p>Programmes are customised to cater to diverse and unique student profiles
for holistic leadership development. Intended outcomes take reference from
the 21CC Framework of Core Values as well Social &amp; Emotional competencies.</p>
<p><strong>Values-driven</strong>
</p>
<p>We recognised the importance of grounding leadership in sound values (Lasallian
and Anthonian values) to enable student leaders to lead others to achieve
goals in an ethical manner.</p>
<p><strong>Sustained and coherent</strong>
</p>
<p>Key messages and themes relating to student leadership are consistently
reinforced and incorporated in the curriculum and co-curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>Tiered</strong>
</p>
<p>To develop the leadership capacity of every Anthonian, all our students
undergo&nbsp;baseline leadership development with opportunities for advanced
development for students with greater interest and/or potential.</p>
