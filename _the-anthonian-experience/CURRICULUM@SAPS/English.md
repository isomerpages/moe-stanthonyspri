<p>The school adopts an integrated approach in designing its English Language
curriculum, guided by the principles of the Ministry of Education’s (MOE)
English Language Syllabus 2020. Anchored by STELLAR 2.0 (Strategies for
English Language Learning and Reading), the national core programme, the
school builds upon this strong foundation with a suite of school-based
initiatives tailored to meet the needs of our students.</p>
<p>At the heart of the English Language Department’s mission is the desire
to nurture empathetic communicators, discerning readers, and creative inquirers.
These three strands are intentionally woven into the curriculum to develop
students not just as language users, but as thoughtful and responsible
members of society.</p>
<p>To grow empathetic communicators, the school provides structured opportunities
for students to develop confidence and express themselves with clarity
and sensitivity. Programmes such as Anthonians Unscripted offer students
authentic platforms to speak purposefully to different audiences, articulate
their views, and respond to others respectfully. These are skills essential
for meaningful dialogue in a globalised world.</p>
<p>To cultivate discerning readers, the curriculum helps students understand
and evaluate how meaning is constructed not just through words, but also
through visual elements and other modes of communication. Students are
explicitly taught how images work with texts to shape understanding and
influence interpretation. These multimodal literacy skills are essential
in today’s digital landscape, where information is constructed and consumed
in diverse formats.</p>
<p>The school also seeks to foster creative inquirers who are attuned to
local and global issues. Using resources such as Little Red Dot, a weekly
publication tailored for young readers, students explore real-world events
and develop critical perspectives. They are encouraged to ask questions,
form opinions, and use language as a tool for inquiry and personal expression.</p>

</div>
<p>In addition, the department embraces the use of educational technology,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI), to enhance teaching and learning.
AI tools are thoughtfully integrated into writing and oracy programmes
to support students in the pre-writing and revision stages, offering personalised
feedback, vocabulary suggestions, and structure scaffolds. In oracy, digital
platforms are used to simulate real-world speaking scenarios and provide
automated feedback on aspects such as pronunciation, pacing, and clarity.
These innovations empower students to take greater ownership of their learning
while equipping them with the digital competencies necessary for the future.</p>

</div>
<p>Through this blended approach, the department strives to develop confident
and compassionate users of English who can connect, question, and contribute
meaningfully to the world around them</p>
<p>In SAPS, we draw reference from the SAPS Teaching and Learning Framework
when designing and implementing lessons to provide our Anthonians with
a sound education grounded in the Lasallian ethos. The framework encompasses
the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) which guides and supports teachers
in their considerations in designing and implementing quality and effective
lessons. The school adopts an integrated approach in designing an English
Language curriculum aligned with MOE’s English Syllabus 2023. Besides STELLAR,
which is the core programme designed by MOE curriculum specialists, the
school incorporates its own school-based programme to develop Anthonians
to be confident and effective users of the language.</p>
<p><strong>SAPS Library Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school collaborates with the National Library Board to carry out many
of its signature reading programmes throughout the year. These include
Book Buzz and Book Bugs. We also design our very own Library Curriculum,
which is tailored to the needs of our Anthonians. The Library Curriculum
is incorporated into our English Language curriculum to expose our Anthonians
to a variety of genres and cultivate a love for reading. Apart from this,
the school library also carries out activities based on monthly themes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also collaborate with NLB to conduct the Raising Readers workshop for
parents of our P1 and P2 Anthonians. Through the workshop, parents learn
about choosing the right books and how to create a positive reading experience
for their children.</p>

<p><strong><em>School Librarians</em></strong>
</p>
<p>In addition, we provide opportunities for our Anthonians to serve the
school as School Librarians. School Librarians volunteer their time to
help out in the library after school and learn about the administration
and operations of the library. They also assist in preparing materials
for the monthly thematic activities and are advocates to promote reading
among their peers.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Our Reading Programmes</h4>
<p>To support our Anthonians with different needs in their effort to master
language and literacy skills, we have the following programmes:</p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Support Programme</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is an early intervention programme
that provides additional support for P1 and P2 Anthonians who have weak
language and literacy skills. These Anthonians are identified at the start
of P1 to attend daily 30-minute LSP lessons which are conducted by the
school’s Learning Support Coordinator during curriculum time. In small
groups of not more than ten pupils, they are taught the basic knowledge
and skills to read and spell words, and to read texts with fluency and
understanding.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><u>Reading Remediation Programme</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) is an additional literacy support
programme implemented at P3 and P4 to support Anthonians who still face
difficulty in reading despite having completed the LSP in P1 and P2. The
programme is carried out twice a week after school by our English teachers.
The objectives of this programme are to expose these Anthonians to a range
of coping strategies for reading comprehension, close the reading gap so
that they read at their grade level, and enable them to better manage their
learning in the regular classroom.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><u>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme is a two-year intervention
programme for P3 and P4 Anthonians. These Anthonians are identified for
support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at
the end of P2. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school
personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists.
Anthonians in the programme attend after-school lessons four times a week
to help build their reading, spelling and comprehension skills so that
they are better able to cope with their learning in the regular classroom.</p>
<p><strong><u>kidsREAD</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The kidsREAD programme is a collaborative effort by the school, our Parent
Support Group (PSG) and the National Library Board (NLB). It aims to cultivate
the love of reading and to promote good reading habits in P1 and P2 Anthonians
who are from financially disadvantaged families. It also provides an avenue
for children from diverse backgrounds to interact with one another at an
early age. This weekly one-hour session after school is led by Parent Volunteers
trained in basic storytelling.</p>
<p><strong><u>Little Red Dot (LRD)</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To introduce the habit of reading newspapers, all upper primary Anthonians
(P5 &amp; P6) subscribe to the LRD (Little Red Dot), a Straits Times supplement
for primary school pupils. Through LRD, Anthonians get to read and learn
about current affairs, both local and global, with elements of social emotional
learning, values education and National Education. Its accompanying lesson
activities are aligned with the MOE EL Syllabus and pegged to the learning
of specific skills such as comprehension, writing, grammar and even critical
thinking. This is incorporated into the English lessons weekly.</p>
<h4>Our Speaking Programmes</h4>
<p><strong><u>English Language Speech Arts (E.L.S.A.)</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to nurture confident and empathetic communicators,&nbsp;our school-based
English Language Speech Arts (E.L.S.A.) programme aims to cultivate Anthonians’
interest in speech arts and provides them with opportunities to practise
their oratorical skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anthonians will start off their learning journey in P1 and P2 with a theatrical
experience and workshop. Various activities will be conducted to help them
to develop awareness and knowledge of speaking and representing. They will
then build up their oracy as they participate in teacher-designed activities
in class. For example, P5 and P6 Anthonians will take part in discussions
and debates on current affairs which encourages them to share various viewpoints
on selected newspaper articles. Through these undertakings, we aim to equip
them with the key critical thinking and communication skills.</p>

</p>
<p><strong><u>Talent Development Programme (TDP)</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This programme focuses on enhancing oratorical skills in debating and
public speaking among our upper primary Anthonians. Anthonians who have
an aptitude for or an interest in honing their oratorical skills are invited
to join the programme.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of a debate coach, they learn to carry out research
to look for substantiated points of information, structure their arguments
in a logical and coherent manner, and debate these points with their peers.
Selected Anthonians participate in inter-school competitions&nbsp;such
as Wits and Words.</p>

<h4>Our Writing Programme</h4>
<p><strong>Writers on the Web (WoW)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WoW provides upper primary Anthonians with opportunities to write and
share their compositions on a secured online platform. Compositions are
first posted online to be read by their peers who will then provide constructive
feedback in order for improvements to be made. Through this approach, Anthonians
learn to give feedback to their peers. It builds a greater sense of purpose
in writing as it helps Anthonians to see that a reader’s perspective can
be different from a writer’s perspective.</p>
