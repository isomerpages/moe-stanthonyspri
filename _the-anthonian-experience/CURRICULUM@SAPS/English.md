<p>The school adopts an integrated approach in designing its English Language
curriculum, guided by the principles of the Ministry of Education’s (MOE)
English Language Syllabus 2020. Anchored by STELLAR 2.0 (Strategies for
English Language Learning and Reading), the national core programme, the
school builds upon this strong foundation with a suite of school-based
initiatives tailored to meet the needs of our students.</p>

<p>At the heart of the English Language Department’s mission is the desire
to nurture empathetic communicators, discerning readers, and creative inquirers.
These three strands are intentionally woven into the curriculum to develop
students not just as language users, but as thoughtful and responsible
members of society.</p>
<p>To grow empathetic communicators, the school provides structured opportunities
for students to develop confidence and express themselves with clarity
and sensitivity. Programmes such as Anthonians Unscripted offer students
authentic platforms to speak purposefully to different audiences, articulate
their views, and respond to others respectfully. These are skills essential
for meaningful dialogue in a globalised world.</p>

<p>To cultivate discerning readers, the curriculum helps students understand
and evaluate how meaning is constructed not just through words, but also
through visual elements and other modes of communication. Students are
explicitly taught how images work with texts to shape understanding and
influence interpretation. These multimodal literacy skills are essential
in today’s digital landscape, where information is constructed and consumed
in diverse formats.</p>

<p>The school also seeks to foster creative inquirers who are attuned to
local and global issues. Using resources such as Little Red Dot, a weekly
publication tailored for young readers, students explore real-world events
and develop critical perspectives. They are encouraged to ask questions,
form opinions, and use language as a tool for inquiry and personal expression.</p>

<p>In addition, the department embraces the use of educational technology,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI), to enhance teaching and learning.
AI tools are thoughtfully integrated into writing and oracy programmes
to support students in the pre-writing and revision stages, offering personalised
feedback, vocabulary suggestions, and structure scaffolds. In oracy, digital
platforms are used to simulate real-world speaking scenarios and provide
automated feedback on aspects such as pronunciation, pacing, and clarity.
These innovations empower students to take greater ownership of their learning
while equipping them with the digital competencies necessary for the future.</p>

<p>Through this blended approach, the department strives to develop confident
and compassionate users of English who can connect, question, and contribute
meaningfully to the world around them</p>
<p>In SAPS, we draw reference from the SAPS Teaching and Learning Framework
when designing and implementing lessons to provide our Anthonians with
a sound education grounded in the Lasallian ethos. The framework encompasses
the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) which guides and supports teachers
in their considerations in designing and implementing quality and effective
lessons. The school adopts an integrated approach in designing an English
Language curriculum aligned with MOE’s English Syllabus 2023. Besides STELLAR,
which is the core programme designed by MOE curriculum specialists, the
school incorporates its own school-based programme to develop Anthonians
to be confident and effective users of the language.</p>
