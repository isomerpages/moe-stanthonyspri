<p><strong>Our teaching and learning approach</strong>
</p>
<p>At SAPS, we aim to nurture caring, passionate, and joyful learners by
designing lessons and programmes based on the SAPS Teaching and Learning
Framework and MOE syllabus.
<br>We help students develop good values, ethics, and attitudes by discussing
real-life social and ethical issues in Science and by providing them meaningful
learning experiences through SAPS Social Teaching (SST).</p>
<p><strong>Progression of Curriculum Across Levels</strong>
</p>
<p>The Science department builds inquiry skills with three main strategies:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>AAPOC (Aim, Apparatus, Procedure, Observation, Conclusion)</strong> to
guide investigations and data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CER (Claim, Evidence, Reason)</strong> to help pupils articulate
explanations clearly, reinforcing 21st-century communication competencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inquiry-based learning and questioning techniques</strong> to show
how scientific knowledge is generated and nurture curiosity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aligned with the MOE’s spiral Primary Science Syllabus, where everyday-life
themes are revisited at increasing depth, these approaches provide Anthonians
with a strong foundation in scientific knowledge, attitudes, and values
for learning Science in SAPS and beyond.</p>

<p>To spark Primary 1 students' interest in Science, an engaging garden trail
was created at the SAPS Science Learning Hub. Integrated with Social Studies
and the Programme for Active Learning, the trail allows students to explore
nature, observe garden etiquette, and use their senses to learn about plants
and garden wildlife through hands-on experiences.</p>
<p>The department uses the following key strategies to support all Anthonians
in learning knowledge and skills in Science through inquiry:</p>
<p>a. <strong>The AAPOC</strong> (Aim, Apparatus, Procedure, Observation and
Conclusion) approach to guide in the design and conduct of investigation
and testing solution; and analysing and interpreting data</p>
<p>b. <strong>CER</strong> (Claim, Evidence, Reason) in constructing clear
explanations and reasoning.
<br>This strengthens pupils’ ability to communicate their reasoning in a clear
and logical manner, in alignment with 21CC.</p>
<p>c. <strong>Inquiry-based learning and questioning techniques</strong> to
allow pupils to appreciate how scientific knowledge is generated, and to
help in the development of pupils’ interests, strengths and passion for
learning.</p>
<p>Taking reference from the MOE Primary Science Syllabus, these strategies
aim to develop in our Anthonians strong fundamentals in scientific knowledge,
attitudes and values to enable them to learn how to learn Science in SAPS
and beyond.</p>
<p>The Primary Science Syllabus follows a spiral approach, based on five
themes that pupils can relate to in their everyday experiences, commonly
observed phenomena in nature. The themes are revisited at different levels
and with increasing depth to match pupils’ cognitive development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To arouse students’ interest in Science, an exciting and enriching experiential
garden trail to SAPS Science Learning Hub was designed for our Primary
1 and Primary 2 Anthonians to learn more about plants.</p>
<p>The garden trail was integrated with Social Studies for Primary 1 and
Programme Active Learning for Primary 2. Through the trail,&nbsp;Primary
1 pupils get to interact with the nature&nbsp;and to observe garden&nbsp;etiquettes&nbsp;while
the Primary 2 pupils identify&nbsp;the different&nbsp;types of leaves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using their senses, they got to see, smell, feel and touch the different
plants in the garden. They had the opportunity to take a closer look at
the different parts of plants and garden wildlife such as snails and insects.
They had a great time going outdoor exploring the gardens!</p>

<p>Our P3 and P5 Anthonians took to the Native Garden to learn more about
our local plants. Our little botanists got their hands dirty - observing,
smelling and touching various parts of the plants.</p>
<p>Through this hands-on learning approach, Anthonians were immersed in nature,
experiencing first-hand the diversity of the natural eco-system. The first
part of the experience included a teacher-guided tour of the garden. Anthonians
were introduced to the plants and their parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They saw that there were different types of plants and observed animals
such as ants and caterpillars at work in the garden. They saw how these
animals relied on plants for food (leaves and nectar) and shelter. Our
Anthonians saw their textbook come alive through this eye-opening experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second part of the lesson, Anthonians had to scan the QR code of
each plant with their iPads in order to access information and complete
the tasks assigned. The lesson was without doubt a memorable and enjoyable
one for them.</p>

</p>
<p>The following programmes are organised to hone in students a keener interest
in passion for learning Science:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Science Buskers</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Science Buskers </strong>
</p>
<p>Our P3s, P4s and P5s Anthonians participated in the Science Buskers Competition

<p>This competition aims to promote the learning of Science in an engaging
way and to generate greater interest in creative science communications
and expressions.</p>
<p>Anthonians who participated had a fun and enriching learning experience!</p>
<p>Well done Anthonians!</p>

<p><strong>E2K Science Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Science Programme offers opportunities for Anthonians to engage
in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding
of advanced science concepts through inquiry. Every year, P4 to P6 Anthonians
with an interest in and aptitude for Science are invited to participate
in this programme. The rich learning experiences of the programmes help&nbsp;Anthonians
to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention
thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
