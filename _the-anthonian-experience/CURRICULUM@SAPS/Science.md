<p><strong>Our teaching and learning approach</strong>
</p>
<p>At SAPS, we aim to nurture caring, passionate, and joyful learners by
designing lessons and programmes based on the SAPS Teaching and Learning
Framework and MOE syllabus.
<br>We help students develop good values, ethics, and attitudes by discussing
real-life social and ethical issues in Science and by providing them meaningful
learning experiences through SAPS Social Teaching (SST).</p>
<p>The Science department builds inquiry skills with three main strategies:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>AAPOC (Aim, Apparatus, Procedure, Observation, Conclusion)</strong> to
guide investigations and data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CER (Claim, Evidence, Reason)</strong> to help pupils articulate
explanations clearly, reinforcing 21st-century communication competencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inquiry-based learning and questioning techniques</strong> to show
how scientific knowledge is generated and nurture curiosity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aligned with the MOE’s spiral Primary Science Syllabus, where everyday-life
themes are revisited at increasing depth, these approaches provide Anthonians
with a strong foundation in scientific knowledge, attitudes, and values
for learning Science in SAPS and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>P1 Trail @ SAPS</strong>
</p>
<p>To spark Primary 1 students' interest in Science, an engaging garden trail
was created at the SAPS Science Learning Hub. Integrated with Social Studies
and the Programme for Active Learning, the trail allows students to explore
nature, observe garden etiquette, and use their senses to learn about plants
and garden wildlife through hands-on experiences.</p>

<p><strong>P3 Digital Trail @ SAPS</strong>
</p>
<p>P3 Anthonians explored the Edible Garden to learn about local plants through
a hands-on, nature-based lesson. Guided by teachers, they observed plant
parts and interacted with garden wildlife such as ants and caterpillars,
gaining insight into how the different living things depend on one another
for survival. Using iPads to scan QR codes, they accessed information and
completed tasks, making the lesson both engaging and memorable.</p>

<p><strong>Enrichment Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>The following programmes are organised to foster in students a stronger
interest and passion for learning Science:</p>
<p>• Science Buskers</p>
<p>Our P3s, P4s and P5s Anthonians participate in the Science Buskers Competition
organised by the Singapore Science Centre.</p>
<p>This competition aims to promote the learning of Science in an engaging
way and to generate greater interest in creative science communications
and expressions.</p>
<p>• E2K Science Programme</p>
<p>The E2K Science Programme provides P4 to P5 Anthonians who have a strong
interest in Science the opportunity to explore advanced science concepts
through inquiry-based investigations. It helps them develop scientific
habits and attitudes, as well as 21st-century skills such as critical thinking,
inventive thinking, and effective communication.</p>
