<p>St. Anthony’s Primary School envisions every Anthonian to be an advocate
of green living. Anthonians will be committed to caring for and protecting
their environment by practising good and friendly green habits as responsible
citizens. Environmental Education (EE) at St. Anthony’s Primary School
adopts a whole-school approach to reach all staff and pupils, promoting
environmental care and raising awareness of current environmental issues.</p>
<p><strong>World Water Day activities</strong>
</p>
<p>On 22 March, the SAPS celebrated World Water Day with a series of activities
planned for staff and students. Staff came to school dressed in blue to
support the #GoBlue4SG movement by PUB. Anthonians learned about water-saving
tips and water footprint through fun and games. One of the stations featured
a tossing game made from recyclables, designed and created by our Environmental
Science Club members. In addition to recess activities, there are ongoing
Water Wednesdays activities in class and on SLS, where Anthonians learn
more about the importance of water security and the need to protect our
water resources. We encourage everyone to continue using water wisely and
make every drop count.</p>

<p><strong>Earth Hour</strong>
</p>
<p>On 24 March 2023, our school showed our support for the Earth Hour movement
by switching off half the number of lights and fans for half an hour in
our classrooms.&amp;nbsp;This is to raise awareness on how we can play
our part, in large ways and small, to save our Earth.&amp;nbsp;The symbolic
action of switching off lights&amp;nbsp;shows our commitment to&amp;nbsp;take
climate actions to overcome the climate crisis. Every minute and every
hour counts, let’s continue to play our part!</p>

<p><strong>Biodiversity Week @ SAPS</strong>
</p>
<p>The International Day for Biological Diversity is celebrated on 22 May.
To commemorate this, SAPS organised a series of activities for the Anthonians.
The Environmental Science Club members learnt about the biodiversity in
Singapore and conducted a biodiversity audit at our school garden, contributing
to the nation’s data.</p>
<p>On 17 and 18 May, during recess activities, Anthonians used portable microscopes
on iPads to learn about the plants and cells at microscopic level and did
a scavenger hunt in our garden. Through this, they learnt about diverse
biodiversity in a fun way.</p>
<p>Following that, the P3s and P4s CODE@SAPS programme allowed Anthonians
to apply their learning on coding to create a prototype to protect our
precious biodiversity.</p>

<p><strong>Clean Plate Campaign</strong>
</p>
<p>From 14 to 25 of August 2023, SAPS took part in the Clean Plate Campaign
organized by Food from the Heart Singapore. The Clean Plate Campaign&amp;nbsp;emphasizes
the importance of reducing food waste by creating awareness of the environmental
and societal impact of food waste and instilling the habit of mindful eating.
All Anthonians are encouraged to practice ordering just enough and to finish
the food on their plate during recess. On a daily basis, with a clean plate
or bowl, they can redeem a stamp from their class’s Environmental Ambassadors,
in exchange for a token at the end of the campaign.</p>
