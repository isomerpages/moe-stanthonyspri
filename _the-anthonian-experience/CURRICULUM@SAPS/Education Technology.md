<p>As the use of ICT becomes increasingly essential in learning, life, and
work, SAPS aims to equip students with the necessary skills, values, and
dispositions to navigate the Cyber space and optimise their learning by
tapping into the affordances of ICT tools with confidence and discernment.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies</h4>
<p>The Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies are a set of ICT and
literacy skills that our students will learn over their 6 years in St.
Anthony’s Primary School.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Baseline ICT Standards&nbsp;define the basic level of knowledge,
skills, and values that our students need to fully benefit from a curriculum
enriched with ICT and eventually thrive in a technology-driven society.
In contrast,&nbsp;New Media Literacies&nbsp;in Singapore schools’ context
are defined as ‘the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values that students
should apply and demonstrate when harnessing technologies for learning’.</p>
<p>The school incorporates MOE’s baseline ICT standards and New Media Literacies
of “Curate, Create and Connect” into our curriculum to better support students’
learning with and through technology. Through this, we hope to enhance
the quality of our Anthonians’ learning and to increase their engagement
and motivation to learn.</p>

<h4>Cyber Wellness</h4>
<p>At SAPS, we believe that all of us can be the first line of defence against
threats in the digital domain. In alignment with MOE Cyber Wellness principles
of Respect for Self &amp; Others, Safe &amp; Responsible Use, and Positive
Peer Influence, the school’s Cyber Wellness programme adopts an inquiry-based
approach towards helping Anthonians become respectful, responsible and
discerning digital users who advocate healthy cyberspace activities.</p>
<p>The SAPS Cyber Wellness programme includes the following:</p>
<p>● Maintaining netiquette</p>
<p>● Recognising and preventing dangerous cyberspace encounters</p>
<p>● Overcoming gaming addiction</p>
<p>● Stopping cyberbullying</p>
<p>Through sharing sessions by the school’s CyTech champions and cyber wellness
assembly programmes, the cyber wellness team continues to surface real-life
case studies and promptly share learning points with the rest of the school
community. We hope to continue empowering Anthonians to uplift and support
one another in our efforts to promote positive and safe cyberspace experiences
for all.</p>
