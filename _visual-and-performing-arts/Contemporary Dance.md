<p>The Contemporary Dance CCA offers students an engaging platform to express
themselves through dance, creativity and performance. It introduces a dynamic
blend of dance styles such as ballet, modern, lyrical and hip hop, allowing
students to explore a wide range of movements and rhythms. Through this
CCA, students can nurture their creativity, build confidence and develop
essential values such as teamwork, discipline and resilience.</p>

<p>Dancers will have opportunities to learn techniques, choreograph their
own routines, and perform in both school-based and external events. The
Contemporary Dance CCA fosters a supportive and vibrant community where
every student is encouraged to grow as an expressive and confident individual.
Students, regardless of gender, are encouraged to come with an open mind,
a positive attitude and a willingness to learn from one another. Whether
you are a beginner or have prior experience, there is a place for you in
our dance family.</p>
