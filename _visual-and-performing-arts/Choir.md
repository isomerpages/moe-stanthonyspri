<p>Through weekly training and a variety of performance opportunities, students
develop vocal techniques, stage presence, and the ability to work collaboratively
as a team. Whether performing at school events, participating in public
showcases, or engaging in choral exchanges, Choir members grow in confidence
and character. Our objectives are to -
<br>• Cultivate a lifelong appreciation for music and singing
<br>• Promote teamwork and camaraderie among members
<br>• Develop clarity, pitch accuracy, and vocal control
<br>• Build confidence through public performances and stage exposure</p>
<p><strong>Key Activities:</strong>
<br>• Weekly vocal and choral practices
<br>• Participation in school and public performances
<br>• Holiday camps and bonding activities
<br>• Choral exchanges with other schools and organisations</p>
