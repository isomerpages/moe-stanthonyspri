<p>The Visual Arts CCA empowers students through two dynamic programmes -
the <strong>CCA Ceramics Programme</strong> and the <strong>Art Elective Programme</strong>.
Students embark on a creative journey where they first observe expert demonstrations
of material and tool handling techniques, then take the lead in their artistic
exploration. Through hands-on experimentation, they develop their unique
voices while mastering various mediums and methods. Each young artist maintains
a personal portfolio (sketchbook) that documents their creative growth
and development. Their artistic journey extends beyond the classroom as
they showcase their talents through prestigious platforms like the Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF) and PAssionArts exhibitions, where they gain valuable
exposure and recognition for their creative expressions.</p>

<p>Through our <strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong> initiative, <strong>Visual Arts CCA</strong> students
harness their artistic talents to create meaningful change in our community.
Under the <strong>Arts Reach Programme</strong>, our young artists take
the lead in designing and conducting engaging art activities for seniors
at elderly care centers, fostering intergenerational bonds through creative
expression. In partnership with <strong>Mandai Wildlife</strong>, students
also champion environmental causes by creating awareness through art, promoting
wildlife conservation in innovative and impactful ways.</p>

<p>These authentic learning experiences empower students to become compassionate
leaders who use art for social good. Through planning and conducting creative
workshops, they develop leadership skills while making a difference in
the community, nurturing both their artistic abilities and their sense
of social responsibility.</p>
