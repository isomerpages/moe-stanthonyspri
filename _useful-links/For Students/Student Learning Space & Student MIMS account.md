<p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Q1: I have forgotten my password or my account has been locked. What should I do?</strong>
</p>
<p>Please use the [Forgot Password] function or fill up the <a href="https://form.gov.sg/64ff51bb4c6a3c00126a6420" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">online form</a> to

</p>
<p><strong>Q2: I have forgotten my username. What should I do?</strong>
</p>
<p>The format of your&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>user name</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;is
a combination of the first 5 characters of your Name, the last 4 digits
and the letter of your&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>NRIC/FIN/BC, e.g. (RACHE1234Z).</strong>
</p>
<p>In rare cases, two or more students might share the same 10 characters.
In such cases, their username may be affixed with a number, e.g. (RACHE1234Z_01).</p>
<p>If you are still not sure of your username, please approach your teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: I used the “Password Reset Link</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Method” but I cannot find my password reset email. What can I do?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you cannot see the email in your inbox, it may be in the spam or junk
email folder. It is also possible that you have not keyed in or verified
the email address in SLS.</p>
<p>Note: The URL in the email will expire within 20 minutes. If the URL has
expired, go to the login page and select "Forgot Password" to try again.</p>
<p><strong>Q4: Can I change the security questions?</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students can log in to SLS to change the answers to their security
questions. However, the questions are fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: What are the Operating System and Browser Requirements for SLS?</strong>
</p>
<p>SLS is accessible through internet browsers on either Windows PC, Mac,
iPad or Android tablets. For a good user experience, tablets should have
a screen size of at least 7 inches. However, a small number of resources
may not work on tablets due to missing plugins. Currently, SLS is not fully
optimised to display on mobile phones even though users can access the
system and resources. The recommended operating systems and browsers are:</p>
