**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

  

**Q1: I have forgotten my password. What should I do?**

&nbsp;Please refer to&nbsp;&nbsp;**paragraphs 6-10**&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;**Annex A**&nbsp;. You may refer to&nbsp;&nbsp;[go.gov.sg/loginissues](https://go.gov.sg/loginissues)&nbsp;&nbsp;for all login issues.

  

**Q2: I have forgotten my username. What should I do**

The format of your&nbsp;&nbsp;**user name**&nbsp;&nbsp;is a combination of the first 5 characters of your Name, the last 4 digits and the letter of your&nbsp;&nbsp;**NRIC/FIN/BC, e.g. (RACHE1234Z).**

In rare cases, two or more students might share the same 10 characters. In such cases, their username may be affixed with a number, e.g. (RACHE1234Z\_01).

If you are still not sure of your username, please approach your teacher.

  

**Q3: My account has been locked. What should I do?**

Your account will be locked after&nbsp;&nbsp;**10 consecutive**&nbsp;&nbsp;attempts to log in with an incorrect password.

You can either:&nbsp;

1) Approach your&nbsp;&nbsp;**form teacher/subject teacher**&nbsp;&nbsp;to unlock your account

2)  Contact the&nbsp;&nbsp;**School SLS Helpdesk**&nbsp;&nbsp;between 7a.m. to 3p.m. as below:  
**Email Address:**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[lim\_suan\_chu@moe.edu.sg](mailto:lim_suan_chu@moe.edu.sg)&nbsp;**or**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[kiliammal\_kathamuthu@moe.edu.sg](mailto:kiliammal_kathamuthu@moe.edu.sg)&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Telephone:**&nbsp;&nbsp;65690822

You will need to provide your name and your class in the email.&nbsp;

3) Call the&nbsp;&nbsp;**SLS Helpdesk**&nbsp;&nbsp;to unlock your account.

You will need to answer the security questions to verify that you are the legitimate account&nbsp;&nbsp;holder.&nbsp;Please refer to paragraph 10 in Annex A for the contact details.

  

**Q4: I used the “Password Reset Link**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Method” but I cannot find my password reset email. What can I do?**

If you cannot see the email in your inbox, it may be in the spam or junk email folder. It is also possible that you have not keyed in or verified the email address in SLS.

Note: The URL in the email will expire within 20 minutes. If the URL has expired, go to the login page and select "Forgot Password" to try again.

  

**Q5: Can I change the security questions?**

&nbsp;Students can log in to SLS to change the answers to their security questions. However, the questions are fixed.

  

**Q6: What are the Operating System and Browser Requirements for SLS?**

SLS is accessible through internet browsers on either Windows PC, Mac, iPad or Android tablets. For a good user experience, tablets should have a screen size of at least 7 inches. However, a small number of resources may not work on tablets due to missing plugins. Currently, SLS is not fully optimised to display on mobile phones even though users can access the system and resources. The recommended operating systems and browsers are:



| Operating System | Browser | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1     |  Google Chrome 64 and later     |
| Microsoft Windows 10    |  Google Chrome 64 and later<br><br> Microsoft Edge 17 and later    |
| Mac OS X 10.9 and later     |  Safari 11 and later<br><br>Google Chrome 64 and later     |
| iOS 11 and later     |  Safari 11 and later     |
| Android 5 and later    |  Google Chrome 64 and later     |
| ChromeOS    |  Google Chrome 64 and later     |
