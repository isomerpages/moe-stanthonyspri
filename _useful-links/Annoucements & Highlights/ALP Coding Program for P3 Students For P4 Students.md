## ALP Coding Program for P3 Students

Last week, our P3 Anthonians were involved in our ALP coding program. Anthonians used their creativity and worked in groups to show how Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics come together. They learnt how to code and program a sequence as they sketch and plan the trail for their Ozobots. With the integration of the P3 Science topic on our human body system, our P3 Anthonians used the Ozobot and Strawbees to show the functions of our digestive system and respiratory system and how the parts of the systems keep us alive.
