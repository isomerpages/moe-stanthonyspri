## Founder's Day

In a scene unseen in the school hall of SAPS for the last two years, Anthonians once again gathered to celebrate Founder’s Day this year with great fervor.

  
This year, Lasallian schools in Asia also celebrates the 170th year of the arrival of the De La Salle Brothers on the shores of Singapore on 29 March 1852.  
  
Prior to the proceedings, Fr Esmond from the Church of St Mary of the Angels celebrated a special Founder’s Day Mass with a number of Catholic Anthonians and staff where he challenged them to continue the legacy of De La Salle.  
  
Inspired by the theme, “To Dream is Our Way Forward”, Anthonians across the six levels split into two blocs (P3-P6 and P1&P2) to attend separate assembly programmes to learn how they needed to go beyond just mere “dreaming” and take the necessary steps to achieve their dreams.    
Learning from the life of our Founder, St John Baptist De La Salle, and also using the true story of William Kamkwamba from excerpts of the movie, “The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind”, Anthonians were challenged to be proactive in their own journey to achieve their goals, guided by the acronym DREAM - Determination, Resilience, Effort, Action and Mindset. In addition, they were encouraged to strive to be a Blessing To Others while working towards their dreams.  
  
As part of the in-class activities, Anthonians created and designed their own “windmills” where they wrote their dreams and which would serve as a reminder for them to move it and “power their dream”. Our younger Anthonians also watched an animated movie on the life of the Founder.  
  
Our Anthonians received a specially designed Founder’s Day drawstring bag to mark this milestone occasion.  
SAPS wishes all Lasallians, past and present, a Happy Founder’s Day!
