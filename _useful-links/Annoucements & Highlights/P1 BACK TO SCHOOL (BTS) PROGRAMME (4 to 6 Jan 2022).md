We welcome our 2022 batch of P1 Anthonians and their parents back to school on 4 January 2022. It was an exciting morning when both Anthonians and their parents get to see their teachers face-to-face in compliance with the existing Safe Management Measures.  
  

The P1 BTS programme began with a welcome address by our principal, Mrs. Esther Choo. A brief presentation on the administrative process for our P1 Anthonians was then given by Mr Kok Boon Siang (Year Head, Lower Primary). Concurrently with these briefings, our P1 Anthonians participated in BTS activities in their classrooms with their Form and Co-Form Teachers. Following that, parents were divided into smaller groups to attend Parent-Teacher Meetings (PTMs) with their Form Teachers. The PTM was an opportunity for parents to learn more about our school and how we work. It also provided our teachers with an opportunity to develop a strong partnership with the parents.
