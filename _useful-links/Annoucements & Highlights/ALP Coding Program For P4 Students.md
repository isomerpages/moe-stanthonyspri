## ALP Coding Program for P4 Students

Primary 4 Anthonians were introduced to micro:bit in the 2-day post-exam coding programme. They took their first steps into digital creativity with micro:bit. Micro:bit is a pocket-sized computer; it has an LED light display, buttons, sensors and many input/output features that, when programmed, let it interact with the Anthonians. Â  Using the micro:bit, they created prototypes for step tracker product to encourage Anthonians to be more physically active. They also created prototypes of smart light using the micro:bit to reduce their carbon footprint. Anthonians showed perseverance as they went about problem solving and troubleshooting. They made their brain sweat: fail, learn, try again!
