## ALP Coding Program for P5

Primary 5 Anthonians quickly warmed up to the micro:bit during the 2-day post-exam coding programme. They took their micro:bit programming to the next level using radio. Their micro:bits can communicate wirelessly with other micro:bits using radio. Â  Using the micro:bit, they created a prototype for an automatic watering system. The system must be able to monitor the moisture content in the soil and automate the process of watering. They also created another prototype for a proximity beacon to help prevent blind corner accidents. Anthonians stepped up to the challenge and learnt that all things are difficult before they are easy!
