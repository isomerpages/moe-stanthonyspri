## National Day

After a two-year hiatus, SAPS celebrated National Day as one Anthonian family in the school hall. Decked in red and white, Anthonians first participated in the National Day Observance Ceremony, the singing of the National Anthem and the recitation of the National Pledge. Spirits were high as Anthonians joined in the singing of National Day songs and watched their peers showcase their talents through songs and dance, led by the teacher and student emcees. Back in class, Anthonians made use of this opportunity to create greeting cards for both the staff and patients of St. Luke’s Hospital to thank the former for their selfless contributions in providing care for the elderly patients, and to send our well-wishes to the latter.
