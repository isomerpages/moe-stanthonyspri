## Racial Harmony Day(RHD) 

On 21st July every year, RHD marks the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots. Schools commemorate RHD for our students to celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures, requiring collaborative efforts from all to promote social cohesion and harmony.Â This year at SAPS, the focus for RHD is local traditional games. As SMM eases, our Anthonians get more opportunities to mingle and play with each other. With this in mind, local childhood games of yesteryear were provided. Anthonians were also pleasantly surprised by the larger-than-life versions of some of them!
