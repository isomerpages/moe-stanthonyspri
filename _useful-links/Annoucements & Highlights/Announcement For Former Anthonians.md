## Announcement For Former Anthonians

Dear former Anthonians,

  

We have received a number of enquiries asking if you could visit the teachers on the eve of Teachers’ Day (Thursday, 1 September 2022). 

  

Please note that while students will be dismissed by 10.30am on that day, the teachers will be involved in a Teachers’ Day event in the school till 1.30pm. 

  

As such, if you intend to visit any of your former teachers in SAPS to express your gratitude, you will need to make personal arrangements with them to be present. Also, please only come to the school from 1.30pm onwards. We will appreciate it if you do not come before that as school will be closed to visitors then. 

  

Please also note that you can only gather at the canteen and the play area next to the bus bay. Do keep your masks on at all times (subject to prevailing SMMs) and be socially responsible. If you are unwell, please refrain from coming to the school and remain home to rest. We are sure your teachers will understand. 

  

We seek your understanding in this matter. Thank you.
