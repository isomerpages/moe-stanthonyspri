**MOE Financial Assistance Scheme**

The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS) is open for application. Singaporean students who require MOE FAS and meet the eligibility criteria can apply for the assistance via the [Online Form](https://go.gov.sg/moe-efas). Please provide all the necessary supporting documents required in the form by 22 November for the next academic year.

Alternatively, you can download the hardcopy MOE FAS application form or collect a copy at your child’s school and submit the completed form directly to the school. If you have children in different government or government-aided schools, you just need to submit 1 application form to any of their schools. The school that receives the application form will inform you of the outcome.
